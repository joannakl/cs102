# Self-balancing Binary Search Trees

## Self-balancing BSTs

How do we recognize a _balanced_ tree? When does a balanced tree become unbalanced?
--

- the answer to this question depends on the type of tree we are working with
- different types of trees come with their own definitions of _balance_ and different
tolerance as to when the tree becomes _unbalanced_

--

There are different types of self-balancing trees,
for example __AVL trees__ and __red-black trees__.

--

Here are the two balanced trees that result from a sequence of
inserting values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (in that order)
into an initially empty tree.

# AVL Trees

---
## AVL Trees

- The __AVL tree__ (named after its inventors _Adelson-Velskii_ and _Landis_) is
the original self-balancing binary search tree.

--

- __The computational time of finding, adding and removing (even with re-balancing)
remains O(log N).__

--

- The balancing is done based on height:
__the heights of the two subtrees of any given node cannot differ by more than 1__.

--

- This does not mean that the tree is complete, but it is close enough to complete
that the performance of insertions and removals stays even in the worst case
at O(log N), not O(N) as was the case with the ordinary BST.

--

- This is achievable by applying one or two (relatively) simple rotations at the
nodes that become unbalanced.

--

----

- Simulate how and AVL tree works by going to this website:
[AVL Tree Visualization](http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html)
  - first adding values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (in that order)
  - then removing 2, 3 and 9


---

## Height of a Tree

__Reminder:__
- The height of any node is calculated from the bottom of the tree up.
- The leaves are all at height 0 (or 1 according to some definitions).
- The height of any non-leaf node is the maximum of the heights of its children + 1.
- The height of a tree is equal to the height of its root.

name: check-avl

## Is this tree an AVL tree?


In an AVL tree the heights of the two subtrees of any given
node cannot differ by more than 1.

<br><br>
__Questions__

- how do we know the height of any given subtree?

--

- how do we keep track of heights of nodes as the tree is changing
(nodes are added/removed)?


---
## Calculate vs. Store the Height Info

If we try __to calculate the height of a given node__ whenever that information
is needed, we need to visit all its descendants. For example,

```
  int getHeight ( Node node )

    if node == null
      return 0

    return 1 + max ( getHeight(node.left), getHeight(node.right) )

```
--

This calculation is O(K) in which K is the number of descendants of the node.

--

----

An alternative approach is __to store the height of each node in the node
itself__:
.left-column2-small[

<img width="150px" alt="AVL node" src="img/12/avl_node.jpg">


```
class AVLNode {
  T data ;
  int height;
  AVLNode left;
  AVLNode right;
}
```
]
--
.right-column2-large[
```
updateHeight ( AVLNode node )
  if node is a leaf
    node.height = 0
  else if node.left == null
    node.height = node.right.height + 1
  else if node.right == null
    node.height = node.left.height + 1
  else
    node.height = 1 + max( node.left.height,
                           node.right.height )
```
]

--

This calculation is O(1) assuming that the heights of the
two children nodes are accurate.


---
name: balance-factor

## Balance Factor

In order to keep the tree balanced, we need to make adjustments when they become necessary.
This is decided based on the height difference of the subtrees of a given node. The difference and its
sign determine what needs to happen to the tree in order to restore its balance.

The __balance factor__ is the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees.

  if ( n.right == null )
    return -node.height
  if ( n.left == null )

  return node.right.height
            - node.left.height;
```

Intuitively,
- if the balance factor is -2, the left subtree is too deep,
- if the balance factor is 2, the right subtree is too deep.

]


---

template: balance-factor

.important[
When we add or remove a node in an AVL tree,

- we need to go back up to the root
(along the path from the modified node to the root) and
  - update the height of each node
  - check one by one if any of the nodes requires re-balancing

- if the call to balanceFactor returns -2 or 2, then we need to perform one of
the four possible fixes described on the next slides

(Notice that the call to balanceFactor should never return a value smaller than -2
or larger than 2 if the tree is maintained properly.)

# AVL Tree Rotations

## AVL  Tree Rotations


When a node is out of balance (i.e., its balance factor is -2 or 2), one of the four
rotations can be performed to restore that balance:
- LL rotation
- RR rotation
- LR rotation
- RL rotation

--

<br><br>
__All rotations perform only local structural changes. They are all O(1).__


---
name: ll-rotation

## LL rotation

The imbalance occurs at a node A (note that node A is not the root of the whole tree,
it is just a node that is out of balance, there might be a huge tree above it):

--

.center80[

A's __left__ subtree has two more levels that its right subtree.


In the left subtree of A (i.e. subtree rooted at B) either both subtrees of B have the same height,
or the __left__ subtree of B has height one larger than the right subtree.

The balance factor of B is either 0 or -1 =>  B is balanced.

The balance factor of A is -2  => A is out of balance.

.center80[
To restore the balance, we _pull B up_ and _push A down_.
]
--
.center80[
This means that the T2 subtree needs to be shifted from the right subtree
of B to the left subtree of A. (Note that this is possible since all
the values in T2 are smaller than A and larger than B.)
]

AVLNode  balanceLL ( AVLNode A )

	AVLNode B = A.left

	A.left = B.right
	B.right = A

	updateHeight ( A )
	updateHeight ( B )

	return B

## RR rotation
