## Graphs: terminology and definitions

.right-column2[.center[

]]

- Graphs consist of 
    - _nodes_ / _vertices_, <br/>the nodes on the right are: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J
    - _edges_ , <br/> these are the connections between the nodes; there are eleven edges on the right: A-B, A-F, A-H, B-C, B-E, C-D, C-J, D-G, D-F, E-D, F-H (they are listed in no particular order) 


--
- A _path in a graph_ is a sequence of edges that leads from one node to another. In the graph on the right there are several paths from A to G. One of them is A-B-E-D-G. 
- The _length of a path_ is the number of edges in it. The path mentioned above has length 4. <br/>
- A _cycle_ is a path in which the first and last nodes are the same. For example, A-B-E-D-F-A is a cycle. 

--



- Two nodes are _adjacent_ (or are _neighbors_) if there is an edge between them.

]]

- A graph is _connected_ if there exists a path between every pair of nodes, like the graph on the upper right. 

--
- A graph is _disconnected_ if it is NOT connected, like the graph on the lower right. 
- The parts of a disconnected graph are called its _connected components_. 

--
- A _tree_ is a connected graph with no cycles, like the graph below.

- A _directed graph_ contains edges that can be traversed in one direction only.

--
    - there is an edge from H to A, but there is no edge from A to H
    
--
- the path from B to D is B->E->D, but <br/> the path from D to B is D->J->C->B

--

- If an edge exists in both directions, it is marked by two directed edges, like B->C and C->B, (or by an arrow that points in both directions, like B<->C)

- A _weighted graph_ contains edges that have _weights_ assigned to them. 

- The graph on the upper right is an _undirected weighted graph_.

- The graph on the lower right is a _directed weighted graph_.

# Graph Representations

## Adjacency List


.right-column2[
```
    class Node {
        label/data 
        list of nodes adjacent to it
    }
```
]

- Each node is assigned an _adjacency list_ of nodes that are adjacent to it. 

- The adjacency list can be stored as a linked list or an array.

- The graph itself is represented as a list of nodes. 

---
template:adj-list

.below-column2[]

.right-column2[.center[
<img width="400px" alt="undirected graph" src="img/15/graphs-1.png">
]]

An adjacency list representation for the graph on the right could be 
a list as follows:

```
    A, [B, F, H]
    B, [A, C, E]
    C, [D, J]
    D, [C, E, F, G]
    E, [B, D]
    F, [A, D, H]
    G, [D]
    H, [A, F]
    J, [C]
```

(each row represents a single node). 

--

Note that in an undirected graph, if a node is listed in the adjacency list of another node, then 
the symmetric case has to be true as well (since the adjacency relation is symmetric. For example, if E is adjacent to D, then D is adjacent to E. 

---
template:adj-list

.below-column2[]

.right-column2[.center[
<img width="400px" alt="directed graph" src="img/15/graphs-2.png">
]]

In a directed graph, there is no symmetry. 

An adjacency list representation for the graph on the right could be 
a list as follows:

```
    A, [B]
    B, [A, C, E]
    C, [B, D]
    D, [J]
    E, [D, F]
    F, [E]
    G, [D]
    H, [A, F]
    J, [C]
```

(each row represents a single node). 



---
name:adjacency_matrix 

## Adjacency Matrix

- _Adjacency matrix_ is a matrix indicating the edges of the graph.

- It is typically stored as a 2D array in which `matrix[a][b]` indicates
if there is an edge between nodes `a` and `b`
  - for undirected graphs, `matrix[a][b]=matrix[b][a]`
  - for unweighted graphs, the matrix can store binary information
  - for weighted graphs, the matrix values indicate the weights of the edge
- drawback: uses $n^2$ elements and most of them may be zero (indicating no edges)

name:edge_list
## Edge List

- An _edge list_ is a list that contains all edges in the graph in some order.

- It is convenient for use in algorithms that need to traverse all the edges and it is not
necessary to find edges that start/end in a particular node.

- Elements in an _edge list_ are pairs of nodes indicating the end-points for each edge.

## Implicit Graph

- _Implicit graphs_ are graphs that are not stored using graphs data structures (like the ones in the previous slides).

- They are used when the edge connectivity can be determined easily and/or if they can be determined using some rules. For example, 

--

  - A graph contains N nodes labeled 0..N. There is an edge between 
  two nodes if a sum of their labels is even. 
    <br/>For example: nodes with labels 3 and 57 have an edge between them, but nodes with labels 3 and 56 do not. 
    
--
    
  - A 2D grid represents a labirinth. The cells with passable corridors 
    are marked with '.'. The cells with solid walls are marked with '#'. 
    Each of those cells is an _implicit_ node
    in a graph. There is an _implicit_ edge between two nodes if the the two cells are connected
    along one of the four sides and they are both marked with a '.'.

# Graph Traversals

## Traversing a Graph

Task: given a starting node in a graph, visit all nodes that can be reached from that node.

--

- depth first search traversal (DFS)

- breadth first search traversal (BFS)

---
name:dfs
## Depth First Search Traversal

.right-column2[
<img width="400px" alt="directed graph" src="img/15/graphs-1.png">
]

---
template:dfs
- follows a single path through the graph as long as there are un-visited nodes
- after it cannot find any more nodes to visit, it _returns_ to previous nodes and
follows unexplored paths from them
- needs to keep track of visited nodes

<p>

---
template:dfs

What order will the DFS traversal visit the nodes in the graph on the right when we start DFS at A?

--

There are more than one possibilities. The exact order is determine by how the graph is stored and how we access the nodes adjacent to 
a given node.

Let's look at some possible traversals

---
template:dfs 

- start with A (visited: A)

--
- we have three choices for the next node: B, F, or H; let's pick F (visited: A, F)

--
- from F, we can either go to D or H; let's pick H (visited A,F,H)

--
- at H, the only choices are A and F and they are both visited, so we go back to F and 
    look for other options; the only option is D (visited: A,F,H,D) 

--
- from D, we can got to E, G, or C (since F has been visited before); let's  pick G
    (visited: A,F,H,D,G)

--
- G has no un-visited neightbors, so we go back to D; let's pick E (visited: A,F,H,D,G,E)

--
- E's only un-visited neighbor is B, so we go there;  (visited: A,F,H,D,G,E,B)

--
- B's unvisited neighbor is C, so we go there;  (visited: A,F,H,D,G,E,B,C) 

--
- C's unvisited neighbor is J, so we go there;  (visited: A,F,H,D,G,E,B,C,J) 

--

At this point we have visited all the nodes and our traversal is:
<br/>
A, F, H, D, G, E, B, C, J
</br>

But an algorihtm would need to verify that all the nodes have been visited. 

---

template: dfs 

Here are two other DFS traversals starting at node A: 

- A, B, E, D, F, H, G, C, J

- A, B, C, J, D, E, F, H, G

--

__Task__

List all possible traversals starting at node with label J. 

---
template:dfs

An algorithm using the adjacency list, `adj`, of a graph with 
`n` nodes and `m` edges, `O(n+m)`

  ```
  visited[N] - boolean array with all values set initially to false

  dfs ( start )
      if visited[start] return   //already processed this node

      visit/process the node 
      
      visited[start] = true      //mark node as visited

      for node in adj[start]
          dfs( node )

  ```
]
---
name:bfs
## Breadth First Search Traversal

.right-column2[
<br/><br/>
<img width="400px" alt="directed graph" src="img/15/graphs-1.png">
]

---
template:bfs

- visits the nodes in order of their distance from a starting node
(distance = path length between nodes)
  - visit all nodes whose distance from the start node is 1
  - visit all nodes whose distance from the start node is 2
  - ...

--

What order will the BFS traversal visit the nodes in the graph on the right when we start BFS at A?

--

Again, the exact ordering will depend on how we store the graph and how we access nodes adjacent to a given node. 

Here are possible traversals for the graph 
on the right. 

  - A, B, F, H, C, E, D, G, J

--

__Question__ Which of the values in the above traversal could be moved and to where
so that it is still a BFS traversal? 

--

__Task__ Propose a BFS traversal of this graph starting at node J.

---
template:bfs

An algorithm using the adjacency list `adj` of a graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges, `O(n+m)`

```
  visited[N] - boolean array with all values set initially to false
  queue      - to store nodes that we need to go back to 

  bfs ( start )
      visited [ start ] = true
      visit/process the start node 
      queue.push( start )

      while queue is not empty
          node = queue.pop()
          for n in adj( node )
              if ! visited[n]
                  visited [n] = true
                  visit/process n 
                  queue.push( n )

# Interesting Problems


---

## The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

__What is TSP?__

- Problem Statement: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

- Real-world Applications:
	- Logistics: Optimizing delivery routes for trucks.
	- Manufacturing: Minimizing the movement of robotic arms.
	- Tourism: Planning the most efficient sightseeing tour.

- Graph Representation

	- Nodes (Vertices): Represent the cities.
    - Edges (Links): Represent the paths (distances) between cities.
    - Weighted Graph: Edges have weights representing the distances.

# Examples and Things to Think About

---

## Graph Implementation

Graphs serve many different purposes and their exact implementation 
needs to suit a specific purpose, so there are generally not among 
data structures implemented in programming language libraries. 

Implement a graph. 
Pick any implementation you want (or try it with all of them).

Assume that the graph nodes have integer labels starting with 1 up to N.
The graph is undirected and its description is given as a list of edges: <br/>`a b` indicates that 
there is an edge from `a` to `b`. 

--

How would your implementation be different for a directed graph? 

--

Modify your code so that it can handle weighted graphs. In this case
the graph description would be given as a list of edges: 
<br/>`a b w` indicates 
that there is an edge from `a` to `b` with weight `w`. 

---

template: challenge

## Challenge

Design algorithms for the following problems. 

- Given a pair of nodes, find the length of the shortest path from one to 
the other. Solve this for unweighted and weighted graphs. 

- Given a node, find the length of the shortest path from that node to all other nodes in the graph. Solve this for unweighted and weighted graphs. 

- Determine if a graph is connected or disconnected (algorithmically, not visually). If it is disconnected, figure out the number of nodes in each
connected component. 

- Determine if a graph is a tree (algorithmically, not visually).



---
## Solving Problems

Try to use your graph implementation to solve the following problems:

- [Ab Initio](https://open.kattis.com/problems/abinitio) - the description
is long, but it is a fairly easy problem if you have a graph implementation
already 

- [Flying Safely](https://open.kattis.com/problems/flyingsafely)

- [Cantina of Babel](https://open.kattis.com/problems/cantinaofbabel) - this is not a difficult problem, but you need to first figure out 
how to map it to a graph.
