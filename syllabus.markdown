**You are expected to know and remember the material from CSCI-UA 101 course.** If you took the course a few semesters ago and/or do not remember parts of the material, start reviewing it during the summer/winter break. If you took an equivalent of this course at a different school, **you need to make sure that you are familiar with Java**. We assume you know enough Java to read and write fairly large programs right at the beginning of the semester. 
* Testing out of the course: If you are familiar with the material for this course (because you self-learned it or took a class elsewhere), you can test out of the course by taking a placement exam. See the [Placement](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/placement.html) page at the CS department website for more details.


## Course Description

This course covers use and design of data structures, which organize information in computer memory. Topics covered include data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, binary search trees, etc.), how to implement them in a high-level programming language (Java), how to analyze their effect on algorithm efficiency, and how to use and modify them.


<!--
## Course Goals / Objectives

What will students learn and do while taking the course, and what will they be able to do or know after completing the course? We recommend a bulleted list.
-->

## Assessments and Grading 

The grade for this course will be determined according to the following formula:

- **Participation and Progress, 10%** <br/>
This category will be assessed based on taking an active part in class discussions (asking and answering questions on the course discussion forum, reading posts made on the discussion forum by other students and instructors), completing assigned readings, tutorials, activities, etc., and self-assessment exercises, actively participating in recitations, and completing group and individual work, completing class polls and pop-quizzes during the lectures and recitations. Several of these grades will be dropped to account for student absences due to illness, holiday observances, family/personal emergencies, or any other circumstances. 
- **2 Exams: 20% midterm exam, 30% final exam**<br/>
Exams will be paper-based, in-person, synchronous (may be switched to online and/or asynchronous if the need arises), and completed individually. No exam grades are dropped. All exams must be completed individually by you with no assistance of any other people (except for the instructor and proctors) or technology.
- **3-5 take-home quizzes, 20%** <br/>
The take-home quizzes will be online, asynchronous, and completed individually. Each quiz will take approximately 30-minutes and will be offered at any time during a 24-hour period. No take-home quiz grades are dropped. All take-home quizzes must be completed individually by you with no assistance of any other people or technology.
- **4-6 Programming Projects, 20%** <br/>
Several programming projects will be given during the semester. The programming projects should be completed individually. No programming project grades are dropped. The programming projects should be completed individually and they should be your own work.



**Course Grade**

The final course grade will be assigned as follows:

Score | Letter Grade
-------|------------
95-100 | A
90-95 | A-
87-90 | B+
83-87 | B
80-83 | B-
76-80 | C+
72-76 | C
65-72 | D
< 65 | F

The grade of _Incomplete_ is reserved for students who miss the final exam or the last project after completing all other coursework in the semester (the reasons for missed exam will need to be verified and approved by the Dean Of Students). <br/>
The grade of _Incomplete_ **will not be given** to students who started falling behind in class for any reason. Those students should withdraw from the course or switch to _Pass/Fail_ option.

## Recitations and Labs

### Recitations

Recitations are the times to have most of your questions answered. These could be questions about upcoming projects, material covered during the prior week or the weekly labs. They are also a chance for you to work with a group of students from the class to solve some problems from the weekly labs together.

The recitations are essential part of the course. You are expected to attend them. They are a chance for you to learn the material and collaborate with your peers. They are NOT optional part of this course.

### Weekly Labs

(Almost) every week you will be given a lab to work on. You should review the lab instructions before your weekly recitation so that you can discuss any questions and issues during the recitation.

During some of the recitation session you will get a chance to work on parts of the lab with other students and with guidance of the recitation instructor.

Some parts of the weekly labs will  be submitted and will contribute to the "participation and progress" part of your grade for this course. To get the credit for this part, you must submit it before the due date.



## Course Policies

This course follows CAS Academic Policies that can be found at [https://cas.nyu.edu/academic-programs/bulletin/policies/academic-policies.html](https://cas.nyu.edu/academic-programs/bulletin/policies/academic-policies.html).  

<!--(Append any course specific policies as applicable)-->


### Attendance

This is an in-person synchronous class and you are expected to attend the lectures and recitations. 

Missing a class or two is reasonable and often unavoidable, but missing more than five course meetings will likely result in decreased understanding of the course content and, hence, lower scores.

If, for any reason, you need to miss a lot of class meetings, you should contact [cas.deanforstudents@nyu.edu](mailto:cas.deanforstudents@nyu.edu) for verification and guidance for an extended absence period. 
Extended absences often result in students inability to make-up missed material and assessments. You should consider withdrawing from the class and attempting it again in the future semester.

### Missed Assessments 

If you miss an assessment due to a religious observance, illness, family emergency, or any other reason beyond your control, you need to notify your instructor ahead of time (in case of a planned absence) or as soon as possible (in case of an unplanned emergency absence). Trying to excuse/explain the absence two weeks after it happened will not work. 

- To account for any missed  in-class quizzes or polls, recitation activities or a lab assignments, several (approximately one fourth) lowest scores in the participation and progress category will be dropped at the end of the semester. All reasons for missing something in this category are treated in exactly the same way: absence due to illness, religious observance, late registration, oversleeping or .... If you miss one of the assessments from this category, you do not need to notify us. 

- If you miss one of the take-home quizzes, the part of the grade based on take-home quizzes will be based on the remaining take-home quizzes. You need to notify us about a missed take-home quiz as described above, otherwise the grade for such a quiz will count as zero. <br/>
If you miss more than one take-home quiz, you need to discuss it with the instructor immediately. You will not be excused from more than one quiz for any reason. 

- If you miss the midterm exam, the final exam will be counted in its place. You should contact [cas.deanforstudents@nyu.edu](mailto:cas.deanforstudents@nyu.edu) for verification of the reason for a missed exam.

- If you miss the final exam, you will receive a grade of _incomplete_ in the course. You will need to take an alternative make-up exam at the start of the following regular semesters (either spring or fall) at the time and place chosen by the instructor. You should contact [cas.deanforstudents@nyu.edu](mailto:cas.deanforstudents@nyu.edu) for verification of the reason for a missed exam.

- If you miss the due date for one of the programming projects, refer to the section below. 

### Late Programming Projects


For each project, you will have a _5-hour buffer window_ after the due date. You can submit or resubmit the project during this time without any point penalty. You do not need to use your _freebie days_ (see below) if you submit your assignment during this 5-hour buffer window. 


Each student is granted seven _freebie days_ at the start of the semester. The _freebie days_ can be used for any project except for the first one and the last one. If you are unable to submit a programming project on time due to religious observance, illness, family emergency, or any other reason beyond your control, you can use your freebie days to avoid point deductions for lateness on the assignment. 

To use your _freebie days_, submit the project as soon as possible after the due date passes and then complete the [Freebie Days Request form](https://forms.gle/gSqPWKjMwi72nVvx7) (https://forms.gle/gSqPWKjMwi72nVvx7). 
<br/>Note: You are responsible for keeping track of how many _freebie days_ you use and how many you still have. You are responsible for submitting the form as soon as you submit your final version of the project. Do not submit the form multiple times for the same project. 

_Freebie days_ are not transferable and they expire at the end of the semester. 

Once you run out of _freebie days_, the late project submissions lose 10% of their original score for each day they are late. If the project has multiple parts, the late penalties apply to the entire project not only the parts that are submitted late. If you submit the project 5-24 hours late, the maximum score is 90 (instead of 100). If you submit the project 24-48 hours late, the maximum score is 80 (instead of 100), etc.


**No programming projects will be accepted after the last day of classes.** 


### Broken Programming Projects

If you hand in a program that does not compile or crashes when it is run, you will get a grade of zero on it. As you are working on your code, make sure that it compiles and does what you expect it to do. Test frequently, not only after you write hundreds of lines of code. It makes more sense to comment out broken pieces of the code and submit an incomplete implementation of the project, instead of submitting a program that does not compile or run. 





### Disability Disclosure Statement

New York University is committed to providing equal educational opportunity and participation for students of all abilities. We work with NYU students to determine appropriate and reasonable accommodations that support equal access to a world-class education.

Students requesting academic accommodations are advised to reach out to the Moses Center for Student Accessibility as early as possible in the semester for assistance.

### Wellness Statement 

In a large, complex community like New York University, it's vital to reach out to others, particularly those who are isolated or engaged in self-destructive activities. Student wellness ([https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-programs/student-wellness.html](https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-programs/student-wellness.html)) is the responsibility of us all.

The NYU[ Wellness Exchange](https://www.nyu.edu/students/health-and-wellness/wellness-exchange.html) is the constellation of NYU’s programs and services designed to address the overall health and mental health needs of its students. Students can access this service 24 hours a day, seven days a week: [wellness.exchange@nyu.edu](mailto:wellness.exchange@nyu.edu); (212) 443-9999. Students may also call the Wellness Exchange hotline (212-443-9999) or the NYU Counseling Service (212-998-4780) to make an appointment for single session, short-term, or group counseling sessions.


### Academic Integrity


This course follows the university and departmental policies on academic integrity: 

-   [Academic Integrity for Students at NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html)
-   [CS Department Academic Integrity](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html "CS Department Academic Integrity")

Our main philosophy is that you need to be honest and fair to yourself, other students in the class and the instructional stuff.

We know that interactions with your classmates can facilitate deeper understanding of the subjects and provide invaluable lessons. We also know that in the _real world_ large programming projects are rarely implemented by individuals. Finally, we know that in the _real world_ you are rarely asked to take timed exams and be graded on them. But you are in the process of preparing for the real world, and you need to prove to yourself and to others that you can be a valuable contributor to a group project or a team.

**All your work that is submitted for grading in this class has to be your own, unless otherwise specified. If you receive any help from a human or use any non-human resources, you need to acknowledge that in your submissions.**

**Regret clause**

If you violate the rules of academic integrity when submitting work for this class, but bring it to the attention of the instructor within **48 hours of your submission**, we will impose only _local_ sanctions (i.e., failing or reduced grade on a given assignment), but we will not refer your case for further disciplinary actions (except in the case of repeated violations).

Here are examples of _fair_ and _not fair_ actions that a student may take. This is not an exhaustive list and should serve as examples of behaviors rather than a complete definition.

**Fair Actions**

-   Working and completing a weekly lab with other students and specifying the name of all those involved as authors (when submissions are expected).
-   Discussing problem sets and assignments with other students in a natural language (i.e., English or any other spoken language, not Java) and acknowledging such discussions in your submission.
-   Discussing problem sets and assignments with tutors and instructional stuff and acknowledging such discussions in your submission.
-   Incorporating a short fragment of code (a few lines) that you find in the course suggested resources or other online resources and acknowledging it in your submission.
-   Sharing code with others (possibly your classmates) that illustrates concepts and techniques discussed in this course as long as this code is not a solution (or a partial solution) to one of the assigned problems.

**Not Fair Actions**

-   Working and completing a weekly problem set and adding names of students who did not participate in the group work as authors (when submissions are expected).
-   Splitting the problem set problems between multiple students and submitting as a group. (Each member of the group has to participate in solving every problem.)
-   Making your solutions available to others (publicly or privately) prior to the end of the semester. (This includes posting solution on a discussion forum, in a public repository, emailing them to other students, etc.)
-   Asking a classmate to see their solutions prior to the last date at which submissions are accepted (this may be different than the due date).
-   Guiding a classmate in their work by providing all or most of the details needed to produce a solution.
-   Failing to acknowledge any form of human help in the submission.
-   Failing to acknowledge any non-human resources used in order to complete the submission.
-   Asking any human (other than the instructional stuff) for help during an exam or a quiz.
-   Looking at another student's work during an exam or a quiz.
-   Submitting work that was completed by someone else for a problem set, a programming project or an exam.
-   Submitting work that was completed by someone else and then modified by you for a problem set, a programming project or an exam.
