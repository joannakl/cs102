You should have been invited to complete registration for:

<!--
- __Gradescope__, you can [self register]({{site.gradescope_site}}) using code MD3DW7, if you did not get the invitation (you
	have to register with you NYU email address - the version that contains your NetID)
-->
- __Gradescope__, you will be automatically added when the rosters on NYU Classes and Gradescope are synchronized (you/we
	have to register with your NYU email address - the version that contains your NetID, not any of its aliases - otherwise your
	grades will not properly appear on NYU Classes)
- __Piazza__, you can [self register]({{site.piazza_signup}}), if you did not get the invitation

__Warm-up activity.__ - distributed during the recitation.

<!--         
__Warm-up activity:__ [instructions](http://bit.ly/recitation1_instructions) ,
[worksheet](http://bit.ly/recitation1
)
-->


---

Once you complete the activity, download it in PDF format:
_File -> Download As ... -> PDF Document (pdf)_

The completed PDF file should be submitted to Gradescope for grading (only one person from your group needs to submit the activity; you will have a chance to enter the names of all group members once you upload the file).

Here are quick steps for uploading to Gradescope:

* Go to [gradescope.com](http://gradescope.com) and log in with you NYU email address (the version that contains your NetID).
* On your Courses page, select the course for which youâ€™re submitting work.
* On your Courses page, you will see all of your current assignments. Click on the assignment you are turning in.
* _Click Submit PDF > Click Select PDF > locate the correct file on your computer > Click Upload PDF_
* (When activity has multiple parts) Tell us which pages correspond to each part/question on the assignment. You will see a list of all the assigned parts/questions, and images of all your document pages. For each question click the page(s) that contain your answer.
* Finally, __add the group members to the submission__: on the right hand side under the name of the person who submitted the assignment, you should see "Add Group Members" link. Use it to add up to 3 more student names to the submission. (__If you skip this step the other group members won't get credit for their work.__) <br>
If you are not the person in the group who submits the completed work, then log in to Gradescope once your group member completed the submission and verify that there is a recitation 1 submission made in your name.

__Make sure that you add all of your group members to the submission on Gradescope__ - it is not enough to have their names in the pdf.
