# Abstraction

## What is abstraction (in computer science)?

</a>

<br><br>
In general, __abstraction__ is a conceptual process where general rules and concepts
are derived from generalization of specific examples.

.small[
__Example:__

In the image on the right, the _tree_ on the bottom is an abstraction of a tree - it resembles
the actual trees just enough to convey a message of being a tree without containing any details
of what specific tree it might be (which in many situations might be irrelevant).
]

--


In computer science, __abstraction__ is a process of hiding details of implementation
in programs and data.

.small[
- because such details are irrelevant and distract from the important concepts
- because the user/client of a given code/system does not need to
know the details in order to use the code/system effectively.
]

--

An __abstract data type (ADT)__  is the specification of a data type (a set of values and
a collection of operations on those values), independent of its implementation. <br>

- an ADT's operations can be used without knowing their implementations or how the data is stored, as long as the
interface to the ADT is precisely specified
- an ADT is implementation independent  in many different ways
- a language independent ADT can be implemented in different programming languages
- a language dependent ADT is a way of describing an ADT using a particular programming language,
for example, an interface in Java


---
## A List ADT

__Intuitive list__
- a collection of elements with some notion of position information for each element
- operations:
	- add/remove at specified positions,
	- find an element in the list (or determine that it is not there)
	- retrieve an element from a particular position
	- determine the length of the list
	- empty the list

--

__A List ADT__
- values stored
	- the list of elements itself
	- size - current number of elements in the list
- operations
	- `add(item, pos)` - adds an element at position pos, restriction: 0 <= pos < size, shifts elements
	starting at pos one to the right (higher position values)
	- `remove(pos)` - removes and returns an element at position pos, restriction: 0 <= pos < size, shifts
	elements starting at pos+1 one to the left (lower position values)
	- `find(item)` - determines if the item is in the list and if so returns its position, otherwise returns -1
	- `get(pos)` - retrieves and returns an item from position pos, restriction: 0 <= pos < size
	- `size()` - returns the current number of elements in the list, i.e. size
	- `clear()` - removes all elements from the list, and reset size to 0

---

## A List ADT in Java

```Java
// List  ADT
public interface List<E> {

	// adds an element 'it' at position pos, shifts elements starting at pos by
	// one position to the right (higher position values)
	// throws NoSuchElementException if pos < 0 or pos >= size
	public boolean add(E it, int pos) throws NoSuchElementException;

	// removes and returns an element at position pos, shifts elements starting
	// at pos+1 by one to the left (lower position values)
	// throws NoSuchElementException if pos < 0 or pos >= size
	public E remove(int pos) throws NoSuchElementException;

	// determines if 'it' is in the list and if so returns its position,
	// otherwise returns -1
	public int find (E it) ;

	// retrieves and returns an item from position pos
	// throws NoSuchElementException if pos < 0 or pos >= size
	public E get( int pos) throws NoSuchElementException;

	// returns the current number of elements in the list
	public int size();

	// removes all elements from the list, so it is once again empty
	public void clear();
}
```

## Java's own List ADT

Java provides its own [`List` interface](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html)
that is implemented by several built in classes, among them the `ArrayList<E>` class.

---
template: section

# List Implementations

---

## Specific List Implementations

A given list ADT can be implemented using different designs and approaches.


<img width="450px" style="float:right;padding:10px" src="img/05/lists.jpg" >

<br><br>
We usually consider two different ways of implementing a list:
- using an array as an underlying storage
- using a reference based structure as an underlying storage

.below-column2[
The differences in how the operations are implemented reflect the differences in
how the elements are stored.
]

---
template: section

# Reference Based Implementation
## a.k.a. Linked List

---

## Nodes (or a Linked List Building Blocks)

The list is usually composed of __nodes__ that contain the actual data part and
the memory address of the next element.

.left-column2-large[
- The first node definition assumes that
the data elements are of type `int`.

- The second node definition assumes that the data
elements are of type `String`.

]

.right-column2-small[
```Java
class Node {
  int data;
  Node next;
}
```

```Java
class Node {
  String data;
  Node next;
}
```

]

--

.below-column2[
But other than the type of data, is there really any difference in what
nodes need to _do_?
]

--
.left-column2-large[
- The last definition is __generic__. It defines
a node that can store any reference data type.
.small[
    `Node<Integer> n = new Node<Integer>();` - creates a node that stores integers
]
.small[
    `Node<String> n = new Node<String>();` - creates a node that stores strings
]
.small[
    `Node<Penguin> n = new Node<Penguin>();` - creates a node that stores penguins
]
.small[
(note: in recent versions of Java, the type name can be skipped in the second
location: <br> `Node<Integer> n = new Node<>();`)
]
]

.right-column2-small[

```Java
class Node <E> {
  E data;
  Node<E> next;
}
```

## Iterating Through a List

A common task when working with list is to iterate through an existing list.

We'll go over examples of how to do it the right way and the wrong way.

## Iterating Through a List - the right way

__What should be the condition used in the iteration?__

--

Well, this depends on what we are trying to do:

.left-column2-smaller[

- go through all the nodes and _fall off_ the list at the end

    ```
    Node current = head;
    while (current != null ) {
        current = current.next;
    }
    ```
]
.right-column2-larger[
<br>
<img alt="iterate through a list" src="img/05/iterate_1.gif" width=100% />
]


--
.below-column2[
<br>
]
.left-column2-smaller[
- go through all the nodes and stop at the last node
    ```
    Node current = head;
    if (current != null ) {
        while (current.next != null ) {
            current = current.next;
        }
    }
    ```
]
.right-column2-larger[
<br>
<img alt="iterate through a list" src="img/05/iterate_2.gif" width=100% />
]

---

## Iterating through the list - the wrong way

Here is an example of a function that attempts to print the content
of the entire list. It is a member function of the list itself.

```
void printList (   ) {

    while ( head != null ) {
        System.out.print(head.data + ", ");
        head = head.next;
    }

}
```

--

- Will the content of the list be printed?
--
&nbsp;&nbsp;__YES__

--

- So what is _wrong_ about this iteration?

## Adding to a Linked List

## Adding to a Linked List

In order to add an element to the list we first need to create a new `Node`:

.center80[

`Node n = new Node();`
]


--

Then, depending on the location at which we are adding, we may consider three
separate cases:
- adding to the front of a list
- adding to the end of a list
- adding at some position in between

--

We also need to make sure that our algorithm for adding works in case of an empty list,
one-element list and a list with many elements.

---
name:empty-lists

## An Empty List

In an empty list, both `head` and `tail` references point to nothing. In this case,
we need to make them both point to the newly created node.

is lost and cannot be recovered.

### Group Discussion: Putting it all together?

With your group, try to come up with a single Java method that implements
the `add` method from our interface:

```Java
// adds an element 'it' at position pos, shifts elements starting at pos by
// one position to the right (higher position values)
// throws NoSuchElementException if pos < 0 or pos >= size
public boolean add(E it, int pos) throws NoSuchElementException;
```
You will need to use all of the code fragments from the previous slides, plus a bit
more to locate the position.

Assume that there is a `size` data field that keeps track of the exact number of
elements in the list.

Make sure that your function works when the list is empty, when it has only one element,
and when it has many elements.

## Searching in a Linked List

- To find an element in an unsorted array, we need to iterate through the array.

- The search in a linked list is similar and we will use the ideas of iterating through the list
with just a slight modification.

## Removing From a Linked List

## Removing From a Linked List

In order to remove an element from a list, we first need to determine if it is
actually stored in the list.

--

As with adding to the list, we will need to consider a few possible scenarios:
- removing an element that is stored in the first node
- removing an element that is stored in the last node
- removing an element that is store in a node somewhere in between

--

The final algorithm has to work if we call it on an empty list, one-elements list
or a list with many nodes.

- this depends on the programming language

releasing the memory (i.e., marking it available for reuse)

# Performance Analysis

## What is the performance of the operations that we discussed?

Assume we have __N__ elements in the list. <br>
_Note that asymptotic analysis only makes sense when N is very large
and as it is growing to infinity._

&nbsp;__O(N)__

  - remove from the front &nbsp;__O(1)__

--

  - remove from the back

# Examples and Things to Think About

---
## Implementing `size()` and `clear()`

Provide the implementation for these two methods from our list interface:

```java
// returns the current number of elements in the list
public int size();

// removes all elements from the list, so it is once again empty
public void clear();
```

-----

Now, let's assume that for some unknown reason the `LinkedList` class implementation
does not have a variable that keeps track of the size of the list (this is not
a wise decision, but we can do that for the sake of an exercise).

Rewrite your `size()` method so that it can determine the number of elements
in the list without using the `size` data field.

---

## Iterating through the list

We talked about iterating through the list till the very end (or past the end)
and about stopping at the last node.

Write the code that would iterate through the list and stop at the second to last node.
Make sure that your code works without crashing if the list is empty or if it has only
one element. In such cases the iteration should never happen and `current` should
be set to `null`.

What application might this kind of iteration have?

---

## Implementing `get()`

The only remaining unimplemented method from our list interface
is the `get()` method:

```java
// retrieves and returns an item from position pos
// throws NoSuchElementException if pos < 0 or pos >= size
public E get( int pos) throws NoSuchElementException;
```

Implement it. In what way is it similar to the `find()` method?

---
## Alternative `find()`

The `find()` in our interface returns the index of the element. There is
often similar methods  called `contains` that determines if the element
is in the list or not and returns `true` or `false` accordingly.

Implement such a method.

---
## Putting it all together for `remove()`

We talked about different scenarios for removing an element from a list.
Use these code fragments and ideas to actually implement the `remove()`
method that was defined in our interface:

```Java
// removes and returns an element at position pos, shifts elements starting
// at pos+1 by one to the left (lower position values)
// throws NoSuchElementException if pos < 0 or pos >= size
public E remove(int pos) throws NoSuchElementException;
```

Assume that there is a `size` data field that keeps track of the exact number of
elements in the list. And, of course, the `LinkedList` class has data
fields that store references to the first node and to the last node:
`head` and `tail`.

Make sure that your function works when the list is empty, when it has only one element,
and when it has many elements.


---

## Adding Numbers

Imagine that we are working on a program that uses short linked lists to represent positive integers.
In this representation, the 1's digit is stored in the first node, the 10's
digit is stored in the second node, and so on. So a numbers 1,673 would be represented by

`3 -> 7 -> 6 -> 1`

Write a function that given two such numbers, calculates and returns their sum (as a linked list).
You do not need to implement a list itself, but you won't be really be able
to test your add function without at least a minimal class to represent these numbers.
