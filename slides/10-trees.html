## Trees - Names and Definitions


.left-column2[
A __tree__ is a structure in which each node can have multiple successors
(unlike the linear structures that we have been studying so far, in which each
node always had at most one successor).
]
.right-column2[.center[
<img width="220px" alt="general tree" src="img/10/tree-2.jpg">
]]
--

.left-column2[.center[
<img width="220px" alt="general tree" src="img/10/tree-4.jpg">
]]
.right-column2[
The first/top node in a tree s called a __root__, it is often called the top level node
(YES, in computer science root of a tree is at the top of a tree).
]

--
.below-column2[

]

.left-column2[
An __edge__ in a tree is formed by a pair of nodes such that one is a parent of the
other. A __path__ in a tree is a sequence of nodes such that any two consecutive
nodes form an edge.
]
.right-column2[.center[
<img width="220px" alt="general tree" src="img/10/tree-3.jpg">
]]

---

## Trees - Names and Definitions


In a tree, there is always a __unique path__ from the root of a tree to every other
node in a tree - this has an important consequence: there are no cycles in a tree
(think of a cycle as a closed path that allows us to go in a cycle infinitely many times).


---

## Trees - Names and Definitions

.left-column2[
The nodes at the end of each path that leads from root downwards are called __leaves__.

The other way to think about it is that leaves are the nodes that do not point to any other nodes
(or point only to null).

In a linear structure there was only one such a node indicating the end of the list.
In trees we have many such nodes.
]

--

.center[
<img width="300px" alt="general tree" src="img/10/tree-5.jpg">

.left-column2[
The leaf nodes are also called __external nodes__ in contrast to all
the other non-leaf nodes that are called __internal nodes__.
]

--

.center[
<img width="300px" alt="general tree" src="img/10/tree-6.jpg">
]


---

## Trees - Names and Definitions

Any node within a tree can be viewed as a root of its own __subtree__ - just
take any node, cut of the branch/edge that connects above to the rest of a tree, and it becomes a root with a smaller
(possibly empty) tree of its own.


.center[
<img width="500px" alt="general tree" src="img/10/tree-7.jpg">
]

--

Each _bubble_ encloses a different subtree with a different node as its root.

--

There are as many subtrees in a tree as there are nodes.




---
name: parent_child_sibling

## Trees - Names and Definitions

Given a node in a tree, its successors (nodes connected to it in a level below) are called its __children__.

Given a node in a tree, its predecessor (node that connects to it in a level
above - there is only one such node) is called its __parent__.

The nodes that share the same parent node, are called __siblings__.

## Trees - Names and Definitions

__Descendants__ of a node are its children, and the children of its children, and
the children of the children of its children, and ... - all the nodes below that
are connected to that node. (In some definitions, the node itself is its own descendant.)



__Ascendants__ of a node are its parent, and the parent of the parent,
and ... - all the nodes along the path from itself to the root.
(In some definitions, the node itself is its own ascendant.)

The __level__ of a node refers to the distance of a node from the root.
Root is a distance zero from itself, so the __level of the root is 0__
(or root is at level zero in the tree).
Children of the root are at level 1,
”grandchildren” or children of the children of the root are at level 2, etc.

The depth of the tree on the left is 3.
]




---
## Trees - Names and Definitions

The __height of a tree__ is calculated from the leaves up to the root.

- The leaf-nodes have a height of zero.
- For the internal nodes, the height is calculated as one more than the maximum
of the heights of its children.

The height of a tree is the height of the root.

(In some definitions, the height of the leaf nodes is defined to be one, not zero.)

## Binary Trees

A __binary tree__ is a special kind of tree in which each node can have at most
two children: they are distinguished as a left child and a right child.

## Binary Trees



- In binary trees there are at most $2^{L}$ nodes at level $L$.

--

- Given N nodes, the _shortest_ binary tree that we can construct has $\left\lfloor \log_{2}N\right\rfloor +1$ levels. We will come back to this idea when we talk about efficiency of trees.

--

- Given N nodes, the _tallest_ binary tree that we can construct has N levels
(numbered from 0 to N-1). Why?

--

- In a __full binary tree__ each level has maximal possible number of nodes.

--

- In a __complete binary tree__ with $L$ levels, the levels $0\leq l\leq L-1$ have
the maximal number of nodes, i.e., $2^{l}$, and the nodes at level $L$ are placed
as far left as possible.

##  Node Structure - Binary Tree

The node of a binary tree needs to store a data item and references to its children.
(Optionally, it may also store a reference to its parent.)

  E data;
  BTNode <E> left;

##  Node Structure - General Tree



In a _general tree_ we do not know the maximum degree that a tree may have (
the largest number of children per node), and because it is inefficient to create
a structure with a very large fixed number of child entries, most implementations
of a general tree use a linked list of siblings and a single child, as follows.


.left-column2-small[.small[
```
class TreeNode <E>{
  E data
  TreeNode<E> firstChild;
  TreeNode<E> nextSibling;

  //constructors
  //and methods as needed
  ...
}
```

# Computing Size of a Tree

---

## Size of a Tree

Computing a size of a tree means counting all the nodes.

Trees are inherently recursive structures: if we pick any node in a tree and
disconnect it from its parent, we are still left with a tree (a smaller one, but
a tree). This makes recursive algorithms very intuitive.

--

__Note__ <br/>
Any reasonable tree implementation would keep a `size` variable, not compute it
every time that it is needed. But the methodology used in writing a `size()` method
is similar to what we will need for other algorithms.

---

## Binary Tree Size

How are we going to compute the number of nodes in the tree?

--
name: size-binary

- If the tree has no nodes, then its size is zero.
- If the tree has at least one node it is the root node.
    - we can _ask_ its left child for the size of the subtree rooted at the left child
    - we can _ask_ its right child for the size of the subtree rooted at the right child
    - add one (for the root node itself) to the sum of the above values

--

---
template: size-binary

.right-column2[

.center[
<img width="350px" alt="size of a binary tree" src="img/10/size-26.jpg">
]
]
--
This gives us total number of nodes in the tree. Here is the pseudocode for
 recursive algorithm for the size method of a binary tree:

```
int size ()
   return size( root)

int size ( BTNode<E> root )
   if root == null
    return 0
   else
    return size(root.left) + size(root.right) + 1;
```

---
## Binary Tree Size - Iterative


- When we looked at iterative and recursive implementations of the size method
for the linked list they were not significantly different in complexity of the code and,
at least for some of us, the iterative method was a bit more intuitive.

.left-column2[
```
    int size () {
        Node current = head;
        int counter = 0;
        while (current!=null){
            counter++;
            current = current.next ;
        }
        return counter;
    }
```
]
.right-column2[
```
int size () {
    return size(head);
}
int size (Node n) {
    if (n == null)
        return 0;
    return 1 + size(n.next);
}
```
]

--

.below-column2[

]

- The iterative algorithm for computing a size of a binary tree is much more
complex (in terms of code) than its recursive equivalent.

---

## Binary Tree Size - Iterative

- An iterative algorithm for size of a binary tree needs to keep track of which branches
have been explored (i.e., counted) and which ones still need to be processed. Since each node
can have up to two children nodes, there is a potential branch at every single node.

--

- Here is the pseudocode for the iterative implementation of a size method.

    ```
    int size ( )
        counter = 0
        if tree is not empty (root is not null)
            create an empty stack
            stack.push( the root of this tree )
            while stack is not empty
                current = stack.pop()
                counter = counter + 1
                if current has a left child
                    stack.push( left child )
                if current has a right child
                    stack.push( right child )
        return counter
    ```

--

- The stack allows us to put the unexplored nodes on hold while we explore other
nodes. An empty stack indicates that all the nodes in the tree have been counted
(or that we have a bug in our code, but lets be optimistic).

--

- Can you think of a way of writing the iterative algorithm using a queue?

### General Tree Size

Using ideas that we discussed for a binary tree size calculation, write a recursive algorithm
that determines the size of a general tree.

.small[
Keep in mind the structure of the node for a general tree and the fact that the
logical representation of the tree is somewhat different than the actual memory level representation
(i.e., the parent node does not have references to all of its children nodes).

# Traversing a Binary Tree

---

## Tree Traversal

We often need to perform an operation on every node in a tree and sometimes
the order matters.

There are multiple approaches to tree traversals and we will discuss three of them:
- inorder,
- preorder, and
- postorder.

---
##  Inorder Traversal

The __inorder traversal__ visits the left subtree, then the node, then the right subtree.
(You will discover why it is caller _inorder_) once we look at a binary search tree.

--

The algorithm for this traversal is as follows:

```
process all nodes in a tree starting at a given node (initially node=root):
    - process the nodes in the left subtree of a node
    - process the node itself
    - process the nodes in the right subtree of a node
```

The algorithm stops when the subtrees are empty.

--

In the above, the word _process_ is intentionally vague. The actual action depends
on what exactly we need to do. If we want to print the content of the binary tree,
then _process_ means _print_. If we need to perform some other computation based
on the data stored in the nodes, then _process_ means _perform the computation_.

---

## Recursive vs. Iterative implementation

Here is the pseudocode for a recursive inorder traversal algorithm.

```
inorder ( BTNode<E> node )
    if node is not null
        inorder( node.left )
        process the node
        inorder( node.right )
```

--

.left-column2-large[
-----

Here is the pseudocode for an iterative inorder traversal algorithm.

```
inorder ( )
    if tree is not empty (root is not null)
        create an empty stack
        current = root of this tree
        done = false
        while not done
            if current is not null
                stack.push( current )
                current = current.left
            else if stack is not empty
                current = stack.pop()
                process current
                current = current.right
            else
                done = true
```
]

--

.right-column2-small[.small[
The iterative approach is significantly different and requires an extra data
structures to keep track of all the nodes ”on hold”: as we descend down the tree,
we need to keep track of all the nodes on the way so we know where to return.

We  make use of a stack to _remember_ the nodes. (In a recursive solution,
the function stack _remembers_ the nodes along the way.)

## Preorder Traversal

In the __preorder traversal__ of the tree, we visit the node before exploring its children (left then right).

--

The pseudocode for a recursive preorder traversal algorithm does not differ
much from the inorder version - the only difference comes in when the node itself is processed:

```
preorder ( BTNode<E> node )
    if node is not null
        process the node
        preorder( node.left )
        preorder( node.right )
```




---
## Postorder Traversal

In the __postorder traversal__ of the tree, we visit the node after exploring its children (left then right).

--

The pseudocode for a recursive postorder traversal algorithm is as follows:

```
postorder ( BTNode<E> node )
    if node is not null
        postorder( node.left )
        postorder( node.right )
        process the node
```

# Examples and Things to Think About

---

## Iterative `size` with a Queue

Replace the stack in the iterative implementation of the `size()` method with a queue.

- Does it still count all the nodes?

- Trace this modified method on the same tree that we used to trace the method
that used a stack.

- What changes compared to the implementation that uses the stack?

---

## Trace Iterative Inorder Traversal

For the iterative `size()` implementation, we traced what happens (i.e., value of
variables and stack content) for each iteration when `size()` was called on a
particular tree.

Create a trace like that for the iterative inorder traversal implementation.


---

## Iterative Pre- and Postorder Traversals

Provide an iterative algorithm for the preorder and postorder traversals.

HINT: this is similar to the inorder traversal.

---

## Iterative `inorder` with a Queue

Replace the stack in the iterative implementation of the `inorder()` method with a queue.

- Does it still produce the _inorder_ traversal of the tree?

- List the nodes in the order that this revised algorithm "processes" them.
---

### Tree Traversals

Specify the inorder, preorder and postorder traversals of the follow tree:


.center[
<img width="350px" alt="size of a binary tree" src="img/10/binary-tree-24.jpg">
]

- What is the fifth node visited in the inorder/preorder/postorder traversal?
- Which node is visited after I in the inorder/preorder/postorder traversal?


---

### Tree Reconstruction

Assume that the preorder traversal of a BST is: A, B, D, E, H, I, C, F, J, G, K.
For the same tree, the inorder traversal is: D, B, H, E, I, A, F, J, C, K, G.

Can you _reconstruct_ the tree?
