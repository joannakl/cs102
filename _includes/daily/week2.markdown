### Lecture 1 (9/10)

Finish with the slide deck from last class (starting at heap discussion).

Overview of data structures and algorithms: binary search, how to evaluate
performance of an algorithm (constant, logarithmic and linear running times),
adding elements to a _full_ array, arrays as consecutive memory locations,
connecting separate chunks of memory into a data structure (linked list).

### Lecture 2 (9/15)

Overview of data structures and algorithms, continued: stacks, queues, binary
search trees, hash tables (basic introduction to all).

### Recitation / Lab (9/11, 9/14, 9/16)

- Q&A about project 1: come with questions to the recitation session
- Complete the problem set for [Lab 2](labs/lab2). Large part of it is designed for your group work during recitations.
  You have 7 days from the time you start the lab till your final submission. You can revise and update your answers during those 7 days as many times as you wish.

### Assignments

- __project 1__: Reading and understanding code. Due __Sept. 24, 11:55pm__. <br>
  Familiarize yourself with the following code. The three files provide a simple implementation
  of a color converter (CSS named colors, RGB values, hex-representation). Once you decide that you understand
 the
  code (how it works, what it does, how the three classes interact, how the user interaction happens,
  how the file I/O works, ...), you will take a quiz on NYU Classes that is based on the code. (For the purpose
  of the quiz, you will use the line numbering in the PDF documents of the code, but you should use the
  actual code to run it and experiment with it.)

  - [zip file with the source code](hwk/project1_1.zip)
  - [ColorConverter class - PDF](hwk/ColorConverter_java.pdf)
  - [ColorList class - PDF](hwk/ColorList_java.pdf)
  - [Color class - PDF](hwk/Color_java.pdf)
  - input file: [color_list.txt](hwk/color_list.txt) - some of the questions in the quiz refer to this file

  (The quiz will be available on NYU Classes next week.)

- Get ready for class on Thursday, Sep. 17: [download source code](code/module2_advanced_java.zip) <br>
    This collection of Java source code files contains four stand alone programs: `Race01`, ..., `Race04`.
    - Start by downloading the source code above and reading the [README](code/module2_advanced_java/README.md) file.
    - Read through the code for `Race01` program: [`Race01.java`](code/module2_advanced_java/Race01.java) and
        [`RaceContender01.java`](code/module2_advanced_java/RaceContender01.java) <br>
      Note any questions you might have. Try to find all the things that looks strange or seem unclear.
    - Do the same for the other three programs. 

### Readings

- _Codeless Data Structures_, chapter 1 sections 1-4, chapter 2 section 6
