## Data Structures and Algorithms
### What are they?

--


A __data structure__ is a collection of data items in a memory of a running program that
are organized in some fashion that allows items to be stored and retrieved by some fixed methods.

An __algorithm__ is a logical sequence of discrete steps that describes a complete solution
to a given problem commutable in a finite amount of time and space.


--

.left-column2[
.smaller[
Examples of data structures from CSCI.UA 101:
- __array__: data items are stored one after another in memory and they can be accessed by
their index number,
- __stack__: collection of items with access (add/remove operations) only at the _top_ of the stack (think of a stack of plates).
]]

.right-column2[
.smaller[
Data structures covered in CSCI.UA 102:
- __list__
- __stack__
- __queue__
- __tree__
- __binary search tree__
- __hash table__
- __some graphs__

# Why Learn to Write Code If AI Can Do It?

---

template:slide

## Understanding Is Fundamental
### .purple[AI Can’t Learn for You]

AI can generate code, but it can’t **teach you what the code means**.

If you don’t understand *why* a hash table is faster than a linked list for lookups, or what causes a binary search tree to degrade to a linked list, you won’t be able to:

- Debug it when something breaks  

- Adapt it to a new use case  

- Choose the right data structure for the problem  

---

## Coding Is Thinking Through the Problem At Hand

**Programming is not just typing - it is thinking.**

--

When you write code yourself, you practice:

- Breaking down complex problems into smaller ones 

- Thinking step-by-step  

- Translating ideas into logic and syntax  

These skills are central to **software design, algorithms, systems, and research**.

--

These skills are also central to **instructing AI to code solutions to more complex problems**.

---

## You Can’t Debug What You Do not Understand

Even if AI writes the code, you need to:

- Read and understand it  

- Fix bugs  

- Test to make sure that the code does what it claims it does 

- Optimize performance  

To do that, you must understand how data structures and algorithms work under the hood, and you must know the programming language that you are working with.

---

## Foundational Skills Enable Advanced Learning

- You do not learn advanced calculus without first understanding and mastering basics of arithmetic. 

- You do not write a bestseller novel without first learning how to write letters of the alphabet. 

- You do not win Tour De France without first learning how to ride a kiddie bike. 

--

Understanding data structures and basics of programming languages unlocks:

- Systems programming  

- Algorithm design  

- Machine learning  

- Cybersecurity  

- Software architecture  

- ... and many more 

Without this foundation, your learning and career options will be limited.

--

**After all, AI can do the basic things, and someone with the above skills will need to implement AI systems of tomorrow.** 

---

##  Employers and Interviews Expect It

Many technical interviews still require:

- Writing code on the spot  

- Explaining time and space complexity  

- Implementing or using basic data structures  

**In real jobs, you’ll often need to build custom solutions—not just copy-paste from AI. That's because these solutions may be
new and unique to a given situation and the AI does not _know_ about them yet.**

---

## AI Is a Great Assistant, Not a Replacement

AI helps most **when you already understand the problem**.

Think of it like a calculator in math:
> It’s powerful, but useless if you don’t know what formula to apply.

Use AI to:
- Get feedback and ideas 
 
- Explore alternatives  

- Speed up boilerplate coding (but only once you know how to code it with ease)

But don’t skip **building core skills**. **Do not ask AI to complete tasks that you would not be able to complete on your own.**

---

## Final Thought

> Use AI to *learn*, not to *replace* learning.

If you master the fundamentals, AI makes you faster and better.

If you don’t, it just makes you faster at being confused and then you become easily replaceable by AI.

[**Linus Torvals **](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), 2006:

> .Large["I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he(/she) considers his(/her) code or his(/her) data structures more important. 
Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships. "]

name: demo1a

## Demo 1: Create a string with lots of 'a's.

.left-column2-larger[
```Java
String generateAString1(int number) {
    String result = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        result += "a";
    }
    return result;
}
```

```Java
String generateAString2(int number) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        sb.append('a');
    }
    return sb.toString();
}
```
]

---
template: demo1a
name: demo1b

.right-column2-smaller[

- When `number` is set to 500,000:
    - the first function takes about __20,000 milliseconds__ (i.e., about 20 seconds) to execute
    - the second function takes only __~2.5 milliseconds__ (i.e., you do not even notice that any time passed)

]

--

.purple[.big[Why such a big difference? ]]

--

.below-column2[


- we'll need to look at _how_ the `String` and `StringBuilder` classes are implemented
- we need to understand what data structures and algorithms each class uses

]

---

template: demo1b

.right-column2-large[
BUT WAIT! I have another version: 

```Java
    String generateAString3(int number) {
        return "a".repeat(number);
    }

```
]

--

.right-column2-large[
And this takes only __~0.5 milliseconds__.
]

---
## Demo 2: Iterating over a list of numbers


.left-column2-large[
Program 1:
```Java
LinkedList<Integer> numbers = new LinkedList<>();
LinkedList<Integer> twiceNumbers = new LinkedList<>();
populateList(numbers, size);

for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    twiceNumbers.addLast(numbers.get(i) * 2 );
}
```
Program 2:
```Java
LinkedList<Integer> numbers = new LinkedList<>();
LinkedList<Integer> twiceNumbers = new LinkedList<>();
populateList(numbers, size);

for (int num : numbers ) {
    twiceNumbers.addLast( num * 2 );
}
```
]

--

.right-column2-small[

In this program we have a list of numbers. We want to iterate over the list, double each number
and add it to a new list.

What is the difference between these two loops?

--

When `size` is set to 100,000 program 1 takes __3,391 milliseconds__ to execute
and program 2 finishes in __~4 milliseconds__.


---
## Demo 3, part 1:
### Creating and searching in collections of `Circle` objects


.left-column2-large[
Program 1: store `Circle` objects as a tree 
```Java
Collection<Circle> tree = new TreeSet<>();
//create lots of Circle objects in this collection 
createCircles( tree, size);
```
Program 2: store `Circle` objects as a list 
```Java
Collection<Circle> list = new LinkedList<>();
//create lots of Circle objects in this collection
createCircles( list, size);

```
.smaller[
Common to both:

This function creates `size` many `Circle` objects and adds them all to the
specified collection. 

```Java
public static void createCircles(Collection<Circle> col, int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        col.add(new Circle((int)(Math.random()*Integer.MAX_VALUE)) );
    }
}
```
]
]

--

.right-column2-small[

In this program we first create a tree and a list of `Circle` objects.

How does the _shape_ of the collection going to affect the running time?

----

]

--

When `size` is set to 1,000,000 program 1 takes __468 milliseconds__ to execute
and program 2 finishes in __161 milliseconds__.


---
## Demo 3, part 2:
### Creating and searching in collections of `Circle` objects


.left-column2-large[
Program 1:
```Java
Collection<Circle> tree = new TreeSet<>();
//create lots of Circle objects
createCircles( tree, size);

//search for a specific circle
Circle c = new Circle(102);
tree.contains(c);
```
Program 2:
```Java
Collection<Circle> list = new LinkedList<>();
//create lots of Circle objects
createCircles( list, size);

//search for a specific circle
Circle c = new Circle(102);
list.contains(c);
```

]

--

.right-column2-small[

Once the two collections of `Circle` objects are created, we want to find out
if a circle with radius 102 got created.

When `size` is set to 1,000,000 program 1 takes __0.01 milliseconds__ to search
and program 2 takes  __5 milliseconds__ to search.

## Demo 4: Calculating Fibonacci Numbers

.left-column2[

Calculate the N'th Fibonacci number recursively: 

```Java
public static long fibonacci1 (
                  long number ) {
    //base case
    if (number == 0 )
        return 0;
    else if (number == 1 )
        return 1;
    //recursive case
    else
        return fibonacci1(number - 1)
             + fibonacci1(number - 2);
}
```
]

.right-column2[

Calculate the N'th Fibonacci number iteratively: 

```Java
public static long fibonacci2 (
                  long number ) {
    //base case
    if (number == 0 )
        return 0;
    else if (number == 1 )
        return 1;
    //iteratively compute the result
    else {
        long tmp1 = 0;
        long tmp2 = 1;
        long result = 0;
        int counter = 2;
        while ( counter <= number) {
            result = tmp1 + tmp2;
            tmp1 = tmp2;
            tmp2  = result;
            counter++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
]

--

.smaller[
- When we try to compute the 40<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number:
    - the code on the left takes __430 milliseconds__
    - the code on the right takes __~0.003 milliseconds__

- BUT, the code on the left appears so much simpler

## Technical Interviews

And if Linus Torvalds <!--, Douglas Crockford--> and my demos did not convince you that understanding data
structures is important and exciting, there are always technical job interviews:

--

- most technical interview questions are based on data structures and algorithms

- examples:
    - design a min-stack that performs typical stack operations and is able to
    retrieve the smallest element at any time quickly
    - describe an algorithm that can parse through a mathematical expression and
    validate if all brackets and parenthesis are in a correct order and matched
    - find all anagrams of a given string that are also words in the given dictionary
    - determine if a given binary tree is a search tree
--

- why?
--

.left-column2[
    - because for a software developer / programmer / computer scientist data structures
    and algorithms are essential tools (just like a wrench is for a plumber;
  would you hire a plumber without a proper toolbox? )

### Group Discussion: Why do we care so much about programs being fast?

- Turn to the people around you and introduce yourself. 

- In groups of 2-4 people discuss why you think it
is important for the programs to run fast.

- You should think about it from two different perspectives:
    - why do **you** want a program on your computer to work fast?
    - why is it beneficial to the **society** if the programs run fast?
(this one is a bit more challenging)

- After ~5 minutes, some groups will get a chance to report on what
they came up with.

## Tips for the Course

- __Understand the concepts and reasons for doing things__. Do not use a particular solution/approach just
becase a tutor or TA  (or even the instructor) said it was a good idea. Do not memorize things if you do not
know what they are doing. Question things! Be curious!

--

- __Use pen and paper__ (or the modern equivalents). Draw things out and experiment with the ideas. It often helps to
draw out variables and objects of a piece of code that you are analyzing and update the picture as you go through
the code. This type of hand-eye interaction stimulates different parts of your brain and helps you learn!

--

- __Try solving problems yourself__. I mean really work them out BEFORE asking for a solution,
looking at a solution posted by others or trying to search the web.

--

- __Write code solutions yourself__. Don't just read the code or watch the video showing the code.
Don't copy and paste, type it up yourself and then compare it to the code we
wrote in class or the code that is in a book.

--

- __Treat mistakes and bugs as your friends__. The more problems you encounter, the easier it is to
recognize them in the future. Your brain actually rewires itself when you make a mistake and fix
it - this is how learning happens.

--

- __Make friends__. Make sure that you meet at least a few other people in the class and get to
know them. These friendships will benefit you and other people in the class, and, in some case, may
last a lifetime.
