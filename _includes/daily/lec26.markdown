__Project 7__ (due date Dec 12 at 11:55pm ):

Familiarize yourself with the code from the textbook that implements a priority queue data structure.
Once you decide that you understand the
code (how it works, what it does,  what the performance is, ...), you will take a quiz on Gradescope. You should use the chapter in the book as well as the code
to make sure that you understand it. The code is in the textbook and you can download all
the sourcecode from the publisher's website. The specific classes that you should
start with are:
- [`HeapPriorityQueue.java`](hwk/HeapPriorityQueue.java)
- [`AbstractPriorityQueue.java.java`](hwk/AbstractPriorityQueue.java)
  
There may be other classes that are defined in other parts of the book that you will need
to look up.
