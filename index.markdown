<div class="alert" markdown="1">
We’ll be using NYU's new learning management system (LMS) called [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/) instead of NYU Classes for this course.

Check out [student training materials](http://www.nyu.edu/it/lms/student-training) for more info on the new LMS.

<p class="hang" markdown="1"><span class="emph">Best way to communicate outside of office hours:</span> [Ed q&a and discussion forum]( {{site.ed_site}}) </p>
- Post all course related questions to the discussion board: content of lectures, labs, projects, ....
- If you have private questions related to your grading, your course progress, or anything that should not be discussed by the entire class,  you should post them on Ed as well, but make them visible only to the course staff (any question on Ed can be made private).
- To get started with Ed, follow this [Quick Start Guide](https://us.edstem.org/help).

- For those registering late: you can self sign up on [Ed]( {{site.ed_signup}}) for this class (make sure you use
your netID email address, or you may end up being removed from the site once we update the roster).


<p class="hang" markdown="1"><span class="emph">Tutors:</span>  the tutors are going to be available starting
the second week of classes on Zoom; here is their [schedule]( {{ site.tutor_schedule_link }}) (updated with any last minute changes).
</p>


<p class="hang" markdown="1"><span class="emph">How to get help?</span> </p>

- ask questions on the class discussion forum and read the questions posted by other students
- ask questions in recitations and during lectures
- get help from the tutors
- talk to us (we cannot help, unless we know there is an issue)
- go to office hours

<p>
Make sure you let us know as soon as you feel lost in the course. Do not wait till you
start getting failing grades because it might be too late by then.
