## Lab 6: Curating Peerwise Questions


### Introduction
There have been more than 140 questions created on
[Peerwise](https://peerwise.cs.auckland.ac.nz/) since the start of the semester.
But some of you noticed that not all of those questions are clearly phrased
or even correct.
The goal of this lab is to
- create some new questions that will serve as a review for the upcoming exam
- review, comment on or flag for deletion some of the existing questions

### Part 1 (as a group during recitation)

As a group design a question that would be appropriate for reviewing the concepts
related to list ADT, implementation of a list ADT using linked list or array-based list,
doubly linked list, circular list, stacks or queues.

Design a _good_ and _challenging_ question, try to come up with several likely incorrect
responses as well as one correct answer and write a detailed explanation for why each answer
is incorrect/correct.

One of the group members should post that question on Peerwise.

Share the question with your TA for feedback. If needed revise the question.

Submit the HTML link of the final question to Gradescope.

### Part 2 (as a group during recitation)

Select 3 or more questions on Peerwise that do not have any comments.
(You can sort the questions based on the number of comments that were left for it.)

For each question in the selected ones:
- Each member of your group, should attempt to answer this question on their own.
- You should discuss the question as a group taking into account
	- its appropriateness for the course
	- its clarity in explaining what the question is asking about
	- its correctness (i.e., if the answer selected by the author is actually correct)
	- its formatting
	- its explanation (i.e., if the explanation given is appropriate, sufficient and correct)
	- its choice of topics(i.e. if the topics selected for the question are correct and sufficient)
- Come up with a detailed comment addressing the above issues. If you did not find any problems
  withe the question and have no suggestion for improvements, state that as your comment.
- Post the comment (a different member of the group can post the comment for different
  questions that you select, if you wish)
- Submit the HTML link to the question to Gradescope.

(The goal here is to provide feedback to the authors of the question on how to improve it, but also
let them know if they did a great job in the first place. The other, and maybe
a more important goal, is to produce a list of questions that are good review questions
and eliminate the ones that are confusing, miss-formed, incomplete, etc.)

### Part 3 (individually, after the lab is completed by most other groups)

Go back to the questions that you authored and review comments
and suggestions that were left there. If the question should be modified or clarified
then edit it and follow the suggestions by creating an improved version of the question.
If you do not agree with the suggestions then
- respond to them and explain why they are not appropriate
- make a post on Ed, specifying the link to your question, and asking other people for comments
If the question is inappropriate for the course (because it covers material
that we did not discuss), it should be deleted.

Since the questions are going to be review in recitations on Oct. 9, Oct. 12 and Oct 14,
you can start reviewing/revising your questions at any point, but you should return
to Peerwise on Oct. 15 or 16th to resolve any new comments and suggestions.
