## Why Do Programs Need Memory

- Every time a program needs to store a piece of data, it uses memory to do so.

- When we create a variable to store information in the program, ex:
    ```
    int x;
    ```
  that variable has three things associated with it:
    - __name__; that's `x` in the above case
    - __value__; that is not really defined above, but could be easily set with `x=5`
    - __location__ or memory address; the exact memory address is not really relevant (and, depending on the
    programming language may not be easily determined); whenever the program needs to
    retrieve the value of the variable, it needs to find the memory address and
    obtain the value from the bytes at that address

---
name: primitive-variables

## Primitive Types Storage in Memory

- For the primitive type variables (`int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`) the value
stored at the memory address allocated to that variable is the actual value of the variable (in binary format).

when a variable is declared, it does not have any value (its value is undefined)

name: reference-variables

## Reference Types Storage in Memory

- All reference type variables store as their value the memory address of an object
or an array that they refer to.

--

.center[
<img alt="reference declaration" src="img/references-6.jpg" width=400px />
]


.center[
when we create a reference, its value is undefined

executing `new Circle(15)` creates an object in memory; <br>
that object has NO name

---

template: reference-variables


.center[
<img alt="reference variable stores the address" src="img/references-8.jpg" width=400px />
]

.center[
_assigning that object to `c`_ means that the value of `c` variable is set to <br>the memory address
of the newly created `Circle` object
]
---

template: reference-variables


.center[
<img alt="reference variable points to the object" src="img/references-9.jpg" width=400px />
]

.center[
since we do not really care about the numerical value of that memory address, <br>we often use
an arrow to indicate that <br>_`c` points to the object_, or <br>_`c` refers to the object_

## Memory

- When a program is executing on a computer, it is given a pool of memory to work with.

--

- The program does not need to _worry_ about any other program accessing that memory.
(Stay tuned for the operating systems class to learn why/how.)

--

- The program organizes its _things_ in two different memory areas:
  - stack
  - heap

---
name:stack

## Stack

__Stack__ is where all the local variables and temporary information for functions/methods is stored.

- It is organized in a collection of memory blocks, called __stack frames__. Each block belongs to a function/method. The block of
a function that is currently executing is on top. Right below it is a block of a function that called the currently
executing function, etc. The block for `main` is always at the bottom of the stack.

name: stack_frame

## Stack Frame Content
### Very Simplified View

Each stack frame contains information about local variables that the function creates:

--
.left-column2[
- the function arguments
- all locally created variables
- the return value (if applicable)


.smaller[

]]

--

Consider this function:


```Java
double charStats ( String str, char c ) {
    double ratio;
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++ ) {
        if (str.charAt(i) == c ) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    ratio = count / str.length();
    return ratio;
}
```

How many local variables are there?


--

.right-column2[

<img alt="charStat stack frame" src="img/charStat-15.jpg" width=350px />

.small[
The stack frame for `charStats` function should contain memory for five
different local variables:
- two parameters: `str` and `c`
- the `ratio` variable
- the `count` variable
- the loop counter variable `i`
]
]


---
name: heap

## Heap

- Whenever the program uses the keyword `new` the memory for that object is allocated
on the heap.

- Heap is not as organized as the stack. The chunks of memory that are allocated to different
arrays and objects can be _all over the place_. (Well, there is some logic in it, but we will not
get into it and it is not relevant for our discussions.)

template:heap

.center[
<img alt="arrow in place of memory address" src="img/heap-17.jpg" width=400px />
.smaller[
Again, we do not really care what exactly is the memory address stored in `c`.

]]

---

template:heap

.center[
<img alt="memory addresses do not matter either" src="img/heap-18.jpg" width=400px />
.smaller[
And the memory addresses at which `c` and the actual `Circle` objects are locted, do not matter for us either.

]]

---
name: array-heap
## Arrays and the Heap

Arrays in Java are always stored on the heap in consecutive memory locations.

Example: If our program tries to allocate an array of 10 integers, we will need 40 consecutive bytes of
memory on the heap (becase each `int` needs 4 bytes of memory on current computers).

```Java
int [] array = new int[10];
```

--

.center[
<img alt="an array in memory" src="img/arrays-19.jpg" width=400px />
]

---
template:array-heap

.center[
<img alt="address of the array is 100" src="img/arrays-20.jpg" width=400px />
]
.centered_80[
- We'll assume that the memory address of the array is `100` (we'll use decimal numbers
instead of hexadecimal numbers for addresses in this example to make things a bit easier ).

- This means that the address of the first element is also `100`.
]

---
template:array-heap

.center[
<img alt="address of the element at index 1 is 104" src="img/arrays-21.jpg" width=400px />
]
.centered_80[
- The address of an element at index 1 is exactly 4 bytes after the element at index 0 (because arrays
are always allocated in consecutive memory locations).
- Therefore the address of the element at index 1 is `104` (this is `100` + 1 * 4bytes ).
]

---
template:array-heap

.center[
<img alt="address of the element at index 5 is 120" src="img/arrays-22.jpg" width=400px />
]
.centered_80[
- With a bit of artithmetic we can figure out the address of the element at index 5: <br>
.center[
    initial_address + index * size_of_int <br>
]
or
.center[
    `100` + 5 * 4 = `120`<br>
]
]

---
template:array-heap

.center[
<img alt="address of the element at index 9 is 136" src="img/arrays-24.jpg" width=400px />
]
.centered_80[
- What do you think is the address of the last element? 
]

# Examples and Things to Think About

## Example 1: What Happens in Memory

Assume that there is a class called `Circle`. It has a public data field called
`radius`. It has a one parameter constructor that takes a radius of a circle
as its argument and creates a `Circle` object with that radius.

```Java
Circle c1 = new Circle (10);
Circle c2 = new Circle (20);
Circle c3 = c1;

System.out.println(c1.radius + " " + c2.radius + " " + c3.radius);

c1.radius = 30;
System.out.println(c1.radius + " " + c2.radius + " " + c3.radius);

c1 = c2;
System.out.println(c1.radius + " " + c2.radius + " " + c3.radius);

c2.radius = 5;
c2 = c3;
System.out.println(c1.radius + " " + c2.radius + " " + c3.radius);

c1 = c2;
c1.radius = 15;
System.out.println(c1.radius + " " + c2.radius + " " + c3.radius);

```

What is the output of the above code?

---

## Example 2: What Happens in Memory

```Java
Circle [] circles = new Circle[10];

for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++ ) {
    circles[i] = new Circle(i * 5);
}
```

- How is the above array layed out in memory?
- Assuming the code fragment is part of a `main` function, what is stored on the stack
and what is stored on the heap?
- Consider the following code fragment:
    ```Java
        circles[2] = circles[8];
        circles[8].radius = 1;
    ```
    - how does the memory image change?
    - what happens to the `Circle` object that used to be stored in `circles[2]`?
    - how many different `Circle` objects are accessible through the array?

name:stack_frame_swap

## Think About: `swap` function

Given the `swap` function


.left-column2[
.smaller[
```Java
void swap ( double d1, double d2 ) {
    double tmp;
    tmp = d1;
    d1 = d2;
    d2 = tmp;
}
```

consider the following code fragment:

```Java
double num1 = 3.1415;
double num2 = 2.1718;

swap ( num1, num2 );
```

]]

--

.right-column2[

the values of `d1` and `d2` and initialized to the arguments that are passed to the function:

<img alt="swap stack fram" src="img/swap-11.jpg" width=350px />
]

---
template:stack_frame_swap

.right-column2[

the value stored in `d1` is copied to `tmp`: <br> <br>

<img alt="swap stack fram" src="img/swap-12.jpg" width=350px />
]


---
template:stack_frame_swap

.right-column2[

the value stored in `d2` is copied to `d1`:<br> <br>

<img alt="swap stack fram" src="img/swap-13.jpg" width=350px />
]

---
template:stack_frame_swap
name:stack_frame_swap_final

.right-column2[

the value stored in `tmp` is copied to `d2`: <br> <br>

<img alt="swap stack fram" src="img/swap-14.jpg" width=350px />

]

---
template:stack_frame_swap_final

__and the swap is completed!__

--

__or is it?__

.smaller[
If we execute

```Java
System.out.println(num1 + " " + num2 );
```
after the call to `swap` function
what will the output be?
]
