## Lab 1:  Warm-Up Exercises

### Introduction

Welcome to the fall semester! Remember programming? Some of you might feel rusty after the long summer. The exercises that you complete in this lab should serve as a refresher.

**You should be working on this activity as a group. Keep in mind: one person does not make a group. You should have a group of 2 - 4 students in your team!**

### Exercises

Some of you may be familiar with a website called CodingBat. It provides coding problems in Python and Java with live testing.
The website tests your code using many inputs. Try to write code solutions to the following problems. Once you have the correct version (that passes all the tests) or an almost correct version (that might be failing some of the tests), take a screenshot of the screen and paste the image in the worksheet.

Here are some problems to use in the activities below.
-  countTriple [http://codingbat.com/prob/p195714](http://codingbat.com/prob/p195714)
-  maxSpan [http://codingbat.com/prob/p189576](http://codingbat.com/prob/p189576)
-  sumDigits [http://codingbat.com/prob/p197890](http://codingbat.com/prob/p197890)
-  canBalance [http://codingbat.com/prob/p158767](http://codingbat.com/prob/p158767)
-  dividesSelf [http://codingbat.com/prob/p165941](http://codingbat.com/prob/p165941)
-  mergeTwo [http://codingbat.com/prob/p139150](http://codingbat.com/prob/p139150)

### Activities

1. Each member of your group should select one problem and try to write a solution for it. Make sure that everybody is working on a different problem. (10 minutes) <br>
Keep in mind that some of the tests may be passing even though you have a blank function or a completely incorrect function. Those tests are based on the input values and the expected output values. They do not analyze the actual quality of the code or its correctness.


2. For each group member:
  - explain to the rest of the group what the problem was that you were working on (remember that they might not have read the problem) (2-3 minutes)
  - explain your solution code to your group; make sure that they follow your approach (2-3 minutes)
  - if there are any failed tests, get your group to try to fix them (no more than 5 minutes)

  If you have time left, as a group go back to problems that are still failing tests. If all tests are passing for all problems, try to work on additional problems from the list above.

  **You do not need to submit solutions to all problems, but solving them is a good practice and refresher on coding.**

3. As a group, submit your solved problems on Gradescope. It is ok if some of the tests are failing. You need to submit a screenshot of the code and the test results (both in a single screenshot).

  The submitted image should look something like this. (Well, hopefully with some passed tests.)
