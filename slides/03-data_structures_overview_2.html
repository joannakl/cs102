__Stack__ is a linear structure in which the elements can be added
to and removed from only one end. <br>
It is often referred to as a __last in first out__ (LIFO) data structure, because the
element that was added most recently will be removed before the elements that
have been added before it.

.below-column2[

.important[
Stack operations are:
- __`push`__ which adds an element to the top of the stack
- __`pop`__ which removes (and often returns) the element from the top of the stack
- __`top`__ which returns (but does not remove) the element from the top of the stack
]
]

We will look at ways of implementing stacks using both arrays and linked lists.
Our performance goal for all of the operations will be __O(1)__!

## What Is a Queue

.left-column2[
.important[
__Queue__ is a linear structure in which the elements can be added at the back
(one end of the queue) and removed from the front (the other end of the queue). <br>
It is often referred to as a __first in first out__ (FIFO) data structure, because the
element that was added most recently will be removed after the elements that
have been added before it.

.below-column2[

.important[
Queue operations are:
- __`enqueue`__ which adds an element to the end/back of the queue
- __`dequeue`__ which removes (and often returns) the element from the front of the queue
- __`font`__ which returns (but does not remove) the element at the front of the queue
]

We will look at ways of implementing queues using both arrays and linked lists.
Our performance goal for all of the operations will be __O(1)__!

## Array vs Linked List Performance

At the end of the _Arrays vs Linked List_ discussion, some of you might have been a
bit unsatisfied with the benefits of the linked list design:

.continue-column[
.left-column2[
Arrays
- .green[constant access time to elements, `O(1)`]
]
.right-column2[
Linked List
- .red[linear access time to elements, `O(N)`]
]
]
--
.continue-column[
.left-column2[
- linear time search, if unsorted, `O(N)`
]
.right-column2[
- linear time search, if unsorted, `O(N)`
]
]
--
.continue-column[
.left-column2[
- .green[logarithmic time search, if sorted, `O(log N)`]
]
.right-column2[
- .red[linear time search, if sorted, `O(N)`]
]
]
--
.continue-column[
.left-column2[
- .red[possibly linear time to add an element (when the array is full and we need to resize), `O(N)`]
]
.right-column2[
- .green[constant time to add an element to the end (because there is no need to resize), `O(1)`]
]
]

--

.below-column2[
<br/>

----

__BUT__ the linked lists give us:
- the idea of connecting elements in a different way, and we'll use it in more complicated structures
- building blocks for more complicated structures
- very good performance when we operate only on the ends (i.e., no need to access any elements except for
first and last)
- good enough performance when we do not need binary search
- good enough performance when we are working with small lists

## Binary Search Trees

.left-column2-large[
.important[
A __binary search tree__ is a structure that starts with a special element called
__root__ and in which all the values stored to the left of the root are smaller than it,
and all the values stored to the right of the root are larger than it.

We will look at ways of implementing binary search trees so that they
guarantee O(log N) performance on pretty much all operations (although this will
require some balancing work!).

## A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

.left-column2[
Professor Physics attempted to simplify the search even further. She subdivided
the alphabet into 8 bins: names starting with A-C, names starting with D-F,
names starting with G-I, .... The students simply need to go to the bin that contains
the right letter and find their paper among the smaller subset of all the papers.

__What is the performance of this <br>_bin search_, `O(???)`?__

<br>

{{content}}

--

 - well this depends on how many students end up in the same bin


---
## A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

__Professor CS__ liked the idea of Professor Physics, but would much rather
have unique bins for each student. Unfortunately, she quickly realized this will be difficult
with many students having the last name that starts on the same letter.
She came up with a _collision resolution_ scheme that stores the papers of students with the same
first letter of their last name in a short chain of papers.

<br>

.center[
<img alt="hash table with first letters serving as keys" src="img/03/hash_table-86.jpg" width=660px />
]

--

__lookup in a hash table__, `O(1)` (assuming this is properly designed)

---

## Hash Table

The last two ways of organizing the students' papers follow the principles
of a hash table: __we want to have a mapping from the actual data (papers
in this case) to the location in memory where that data is stored__.

- Professor Physics and Professor CS use a first letter of the student's name
to determine where their paper should be located.

- Each letter of the alphabet is then stored in a bin or a list of papers
that students can _quickly_ search through.

## Summary of Important Concepts

Stack (last in, first out)
- operations allowed only at one end: `push`, `pop`, `top`
- goal: `O(1)` performance for `push` and `pop`

--


Queue (first in, first out)
- operations allowed only at the two ends: `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `front`
- goal: `O(1)` performance for `enqueue` and `dequeue`

--

Binary Search Tree
- gaining back the binary search for _sorted_ data
- goal: `O(logN)` performance for almost all operations

--

Hash Tables
- allows fast look-ups based on some characteristic of the data (ex., first letter of the last name)
- goal: `O(1)` performance for almost all operations (challenging to implement to achieve this)

# Examples and Things to Think About

---

## Stacking Things Up

Consider the following sequence of operations on an initially empty stack.
Show the stack content at each of the indicated lines. Make sure to indicate
where the top and the bottom of your stack are.

```java
push 5
push 10
push 23
pop
push 17
top
push 10
// show the content of the stack
pop
TMP = pop
push 5 * TMP
// show the content of the stack
TMP = top
push 10 * TMP
push 100 * TMP
// show the content of the stack
pop
pop
pop
// show the content of the stack

```

---

## Queuing Up

Consider the following sequence of operations on an initially empty queue.
Show the queue content at each of the indicated lines. Make sure to indicate
where the front and the back of your queue are.

```java
enqueue 5
enqueue 10
enqueue 23
dequeue
enqueue 17
front
enqueue 10
// show the content of the queue
dequeue
TMP = dequeue
enqueue 5 * TMP
// show the content of the queue
TMP = front
enqueue 10 * TMP
enqueue 100 * TMP
// show the content of the queue
dequeue
dequeue
dequeue
// show the content of the queue

```

---

## Working with a Binary Search Tree

Consider the binary search tree from one of the earlier slides:

.center[
<img alt="balanced bst" src="img/03/bst-84.jpg" width=400px />
]

- If we decide to add a few more values to this tree, where do you think the
nodes should be connected?  Here are a few values to be added: __65__, __14__, __27__.
Make sure that the resulting tree is still a binary search tree!

- Try to design an algorithm that determines the smallest/largest value
that is stored in a binary search tree.

- Try to design an algorithm that determines the largest value that is smaller
than the root (or rather the value stored in the root node). <br>
Is this algorithm in any way similar to the algorithm you suggested for the
previous prompt?

---

## Better Organization for Papers

Our _Star Wars_ characters are not from a very large class, so they can
quickly find their papers when they are mapped based on the first letters
of their names.

But imagine a much much much larger group: __what if we had hundreds or thousands
of students__? Each letter of the alphabet would have a huge number of papers
associated with it.

__Your mission__: Come up with a more unique way of mapping student names to locations
where their papers might be stored?
