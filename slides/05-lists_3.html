# Other _Flavors_ of a Linked List

## Other _Flavors_ of a Linked List

The list that we discussed extensively is a __singly linked list__. In that list
- there is a single reference from a node to the node that follows, and
- the last node's reference is set to `null`.

--

In a __doubly linked list__ there is a double connection between the nodes:
each node has a reference to the node that follows and to the node that precedes it.

--

In a __circular linked list__ the last node is connected back to the first node (instead of having its reference set to null).
Circular linked lists could be singly- or doubly linked.

---

## Doubly Linked List


.center[
<img alt="doubly linked list "  width="700"  src="img/05/doubly-linked-61.jpg"/>
]

--

.right-column2[
```java
class Node<E> {
    E data;
    Node<E> next;
    Node<E> prev;
}
```

<img alt="nodes in doubly linked list "  width="100%" src="img/05/doubly-linked-62.jpg"/>
]

--

- Working with a doubly linked list is very similar to working with a singly
linked list, but there are twice as many references to keep track of.

--
- Some operations become more efficient. For example, removing the last node, since `tail.prev`
provides the reference to the node before last and it does not require iterating through the entire list.

--
- Java's `LinkedList<E>` class uses a doubly linked list implementation.

---

## Circular Linked List

.right-column2[
Circular __singly__ linked list.

- there is a single reference in each node pointing to the next node
- the last node's reference, points back to the first node

.left-column2[

]
.right-column2[
Circular __doubly__ linked list.

- there two references between a pair of any nodes: one pointing forward,
the other pointing back
- the last node's `next` reference, points back to the first node
- the first node's `prev` reference, points to the last node

# List Equivalence

### Group Discussion: Checking If Two Lists are Equal?

We looked at a method that tested if two `ArrayList<E>` objects were equal.

Your task is to come up with a similar test for a singly linked list.

Remember the _steps_ that the method for the `ArrayList<E>` class took:
- check if the specified object is this list
- check if the specified object is a list
- check if the lists contain the same elements in the same order

Use the LinkedList class on Ed and add the `equals` method to it. For this
implementation the second step above should just check if "the specified object
is a LinkedList" (not an arbitrary list).

----
Once person in your group should fork the publically available LinkedList workspace and
share it with the other people in the group __and with Joanna at jk157@nyu.edu__.

# Defining and Iterator for our LinkedList

## Why do we need iterators?

An iterator is an object that allows us to traverse a collection (data structure)
and visit each element exactly once.

__Objective:__ be able to return the _next_ element fast, i.e., in O(1), so that the
entire collection can be traversed in O(N) time.

## Why do we need iterators?

Here is an example of iterating over an `ArrayList<E>` object using an ordinary
    `for` loop and the `get(index)` method and using an iterator.

```java
ArrayList<String> aL = new ArrayList<>();
String [] strings = {"hello", "big", "pink", "cat"};
for (int i = 0; i < strings.length; i++) {
    aL.add(strings[i]);
}

System.out.println("Using for loop with .get() method" );
for (int i = 0; i < aL.size(); i++ ) {
    System.out.println(aL.get(i));
}

System.out.println("Using an iterator" );
Iterator<String> itr = aL.iterator();
while (itr.hasNext()){
    System.out.println(itr.next() );
}
```
--
What is the performance of each method?
- using or loop with .get() method
- using an iterator

Here is an example of iterating over an `LinkedList<E>` object using an ordinary

```java
LinkedList<String> lL = new LinkedList<>();
String [] strings = {"hello", "big", "pink", "cat"};
for (int i = 0; i < strings.length; i++) {
    lL.add(strings[i]);
}

System.out.println("Using for loop with .get() method" );

    System.out.println(lL.get(i));
}

System.out.println("Using an iterator" );

What is the performance of each method?
- using or loop with .get() method   __O(N<sup>2</sup>)__ (because the `get()` method takes O(N) time)
- using an iterator  __O(N)__

## How to Implement an Iterator for a Linked List

Here is a __very simple__ iterator to satisfies the `Iterator<E>` interface:


```java
private class Itr implements Iterator<E> {
    private Node<E> current = head;

    public boolean hasNext() {
        return current != null;
    }

    public E next()
    {
        E tmp = current.data;
        current = current.next;
        return tmp;
    }
}
```

--

and to make the list itself `Iterable`, we need to add the following method to the list

```java
public Iterator<E> iterator() {
    return new Itr();
}
```

# Examples and Things to Think About

---

## `LinkedList<E>` source code

Study the source code of a doubly linked list implementation provided by
the `LinkedList<E>` class in Java.

You should be able to understand what it does and why.

---

## Is it circular?

Given a reference to the first node, i.e. `head` determine if the list is circular or not.

- case 1: assume that there is a `tail` reference pointing to the last node
- case 2: assume that there is no `tail` reference

What is the performance of these two methods.

---

## Does it have a loop?


Given a reference to the first node, i.e. `head` determine if the list has a loop or not
(a loop in a list means that the last node points back to another node in the list).

---
## What will this code output?

Assume that we execute the following code fragment. What is the output?

```java

ArrayList<String> aL = new ArrayList<>();
String [] strings = {"hello", "big", "pink", "cat"};
for (int i = 0; i < strings.length; i++) {
    aL.add(strings[i]);
}

Iterator<String> itr = aL.iterator();
System.out.println(itr.next() );
itr.next();
System.out.println(itr.next() );

Iterator<String> itr1 = aL.iterator();
Iterator<String> itr2 = aL.iterator();
System.out.println(itr1.next());
System.out.println(itr2.next());

System.out.println(itr.next());


```
