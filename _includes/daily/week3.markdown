### Assignments

- Continue working on Project 1.
- Create one review question on Peerwise that would be useful for material review for
    the take-home quiz 1. The review questions should clearly explain what they are asking
    for, provide several answers with one correct answer (the incorrect answers should be
    likely answers, not something obviously wrong), provide explanation of the answers
    (why are the wrongs ones wrong, and how does one get the correct answer). <br>
    Due: Saturday, Sept. 26 by midnight
- Answer some of the review questions on Peerwise and provide feedback for them (either
    just assessing their difficulty and quality or writing actual comments if appropriate). <br>
    Due: Monday, Sept. 28 by midnight
- Get ready for take-home quiz 1. Will be given on Sept. 29.
