## Race02

- What is SCREEN_HEIGHT? How do we know what its value is?
- In the contender class why is the variable protected instead of private or public?
- Why are there cases with no statements after them, for example case 0 for Duck03 class
- Why a switch statement instead of a more intuitive if/else conditional to control probability?
- What is switch-case?
- Why is there nothing in the brackets for the Catch statement? What is executed if there is an exception?
- Why does integer LARGEST_MOVE have to be final? What is the meaning of the final keyword?
- What is dynamic binding in the Rabbit/Duck/Snail classes?
- What is the difference between private and protected?
- How does switch-case work?
- Why is @param used?
- What is printf() and how does “%s” grab the respective winner?
- How does the switch case operate to let you generate different movement patterns & chances for patterns? Ex. a whichMove = 1 for Duck executes the short flight move stored in case 6.  Why would you use case statements over an if statement
- Why not rename different contenders’ moves to their specific types (ex. duckMove) instead of using @Override?
- Why random class over Math.random?
- Why is the abstract class not used as opposed to race03 or race04
- What’s “protected” in front of the String/int variable?
- Why specify this for the number but not the position in the object RaceContender contructors
- What does the Thread.sleep(1000); in line 72 mean?
- Why does Thread.sleep throw an exception?
- What if the race is tied?
- What does the “switch” statement do?
- Duck-02: Why are some of the cases empty?
- Line 110: Why is there nothing before the first semi-colon?
- What is the difference between the different RaceContender classes?
- Why not use dynamic binding for Rabbit02?
- How does @param number work in Duck02?
- Why are there cases which are empty in Duck, Rabbit and Snail?
- What does this comment mean? How should we interpret it?
/* (non-Javadoc)
* @see java.lang.Object#toString()
*/
- Where did we use the method toString in Race02, Race03, Race04? If we didn’t use it, why did we override it?
- What is InterruptedException e?
- Why is the semicolon inside of the bracket? try{Thread.sleep(500);}
- What do the different symbols do in a printf statement?
- Why is there nothing before the semicolon? for ( ; i < FINISH_LINE; i++ )
- Above cases are considered higher cases in Duck/Rabbit/Snail switch
- Why not add “abstract” to “public void move()”? (RaceContender02)
- 8. Why is there so much repeated code?
- What command are we using to create the speed for the race contenders?
- If multiple racers finish at the same time, what happens?
- Why not use different constructors instead of creating new classes?
- Why not iterate through the racers instead of going through them one by one?
- What does %s mean in printf?
- Line 110 - Why is the syntax for( ; i) ? What’s the semicolon purpose?
- In Rabbit02 - What is the purpose of the switch statement block?
- In the contender classes, go over what @override does (syntax wise?)
- Specifically: What is the purpose of Thread.Sleep() (the use of thread?)
- Why do we have blank cases?
- How does the switch method within the move method work?
- What does “protected” mean in Java (in all races)?
- Lines 54 - 69 , what happens if tied?
- Line 88 - why catch(InterruptedException e){}, and why is it empty?
- (racecontender) Line 38 - what does nextInt do exactly
- (Duck) Lines 33-46 - why are empty cases there
- Switch statement
- Printf formatting and special symbols?
- Do empty cases matter?
- What’s the purpose of the toString() function?
