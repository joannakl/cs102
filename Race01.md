## Race01

- What is the exception “InturruptEception”
- How is rand.nextInt() implemented?
- position = position + rand.nextInt(LARGEST_MOVE)+1; Why the plus 1?
- What is the exception, and what is interrupted in the exception
- What is the Thread class, and what is the thread.sleep() method
- Why is there nothing in the Catch block, how would we handle it if exception occured
- What’s the point of having multiple race contender classes?
- What’s the point of the try/catch block (Thread.sleep)?
- Is there a better way to clear the screen other than just printing out spaces?
- Does catching and ignoring the interrupted exception prevent a user from quitting the program early?
- What is the role of the following code: catch(InterruptedException e)?
- What does the protected keyword mean for variables?
- Difference between private and protected
- What is InterruptedException?
- When multiple contenders cross the finish line at the same time, only the one that comes first in the array is counted as the winner
- In line 38, what is catch(InterruptedException e){} doing?
- Why clearScreen() and printPosition() have to be static methods?
- What is a Thread?
- Why is there a catch statement under the try statement for Thread.sleep?
- Is there a more efficient way to clear the screen besides spamming spaces?
- What does the protected declaration(?) do for number and position?
- What does @Override do?
- Why is the catch block empty? Is this good practice?
- Why does Thread.sleep() throw an Interrupted Exception?
- What is a thread? What is the purpose of thread in this program?
- What's the thread?
- What is InterruptedException?
- Why specify this for the number but not the position in the object RaceContender constructors
- Why error handle a thread sleep command?
- What specifically is InterruptedException (line 38 and line 59)
- What does “thread.sleep” do? (line 58)
- Why would thread.sleep throw an exception?
- Why use protected variables for number and position in RaceContender01?
- Why does the for loop in line 95 begin with a semicolon?
- Line 95 in Race0- java - for ( ; i < FINISH_LINE; i++)
- RaceContender0- java has both a toString() and getNumber() method that do the same thing, so why have both?
- When running the code, why do I get numbers of maps showing each step of the printPosition() method instead of just one map showing the whole process?
- What is the “Thread” class?
- Why put it in the “Try-Except” block?
- What is printf?
- Line 59: Why is the exception block empty?
- try{Thread.sleep(500);} (how does this work?)
- What is InterruptedException? What’s its purpose and how will it help the program?
- What is the purpose of writing @param and @return?
- What is printf?
- What is try/catch in line 36?
- What is Thread.sleep(500)?
- What is @param, and what does it do
- Format of for loop on line 95
- In the Contender class, why protected vs. private?
- Why protected vs. public if they’re all in same package?
- Why is move() overridden in all of RaceContender01’s children, yet still defined in RaceContender01?
- Why is there so much repeated code?
- What does thread.sleep do?
- What does the final keyword do?
- What is the point of the catch block for the thread.sleep?
- When would it be executed.
- How is the screen height universal?
- What does clearScreen() do?
- What exactly is InterruptedException when it’s being caught?
- Why do we need a try and catch loop when we wait 500ms before each movement?
- What does printf do differently from println?
- How does the code deal with ties?
- Purpose of lines 58/59 (why the Try/Catch? What are we catching?)
- Purpose of using .sleep(int i) ?
- Why do you have to wait a second after the race finishes?
- General question about .super() (b/c it should be automatic?)
- Why do we need to catch exceptions after waiting?
- What does override mean?
- Why does the for loop in line 95 not have an initialization?
- Why do you need to write public static for some of the declared variables?
- What does the “thread” method do? (Line 37)
- What does the “this.number” indicate?
- How does the “clearScreen” method work?
- Line 37 - what does Thread.sleep mean
- Line 64 - meaning of %s
- What could cause the thread to be interrupted?
- I’ve never seen System.out.printf before. How is that different from System.out.println?
- What’s the meaning of Screen and how is it used?
- What is Thread.sleep(500), what does it do, and why is it in a try/catch block?
- Why do the variables in RaceContender have to be protected?
- Why is a value not initialized in the last for loop in the printPosition method?
- Why is the second for statement missing curly brackets at the end of printPosition?
- What is Thread.sleep and what does it do?
- Why are the number and position variables in the RaceContender class declared private?
- What is thread.sleep and why is 500 ms ideal? (Lines 34 - 38)
- Why use protected for the instance variables in RaceContender01?
- Why/when does Thread.sleep(500) throw an exception?
- Is Race0- java an object in itself?
- Why is variable i not written in for loop (line 95)?
- What’s the purpose of the Thread.sleep() function & how does it work?
- Why do we need try-catch blocks? Why can’t we just have the Thread.sleep() function by itself?
