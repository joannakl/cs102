## Why do I need to read code


- understanding existing code base 

- debugging skills 

- code review 

- learning new things 

- code interviews 



---

## Process of reading a new codebase 

- __get a big picture__ - run the code if possible to see what it does, understand the purpose of the whole program and its general behavior 

--

- __understand the structure__ - look at the files, how are they organized, what do they contain where is the entry point for the program, if available, read the top level documentation for each file/class 

--

- __study the overall logic__ - look at the _big_ code blocks and functions, what is the flow of the program

--

- __dive into details__ - start reading functions and code blocks more carefully, determine data structures that are used, figure out any parts that are unclear 

--

- __test-drive the program__ - once you understand more of the code, run the program and try to break it, what assumptions does it make about the _outside world behavior_, are there situations that it cannot handle 

--

- analyze the performance__ - think through data structures and algorithms to analyze overall performance of the program, can things be improved or optimized 



---


## Things that may help

- take notes 

- draw diagrams 

- read the available README files and documentation (both class level, function level and inline) 

- write questions about parts you do not understand or that are confusing 

- ask questions
