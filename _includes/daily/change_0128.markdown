We will be using many different tools to facilitate course discussions, assessments, reviews, practice sessions, etc.
At the start of the semester you will need to sign up for several of these tools and resources:

- __NYU Brightspace__

  This is a replacement for NYU Classes. In the Fall 2021 semester all NYU courses will be using it. We are getting a head-start
  on it this semester.

  You should log in to the site and make sure that you see the page specific for the Data Structures class.


- __OpenDSA/Canvas__

  OpenDSA is an open source project whose goal is to provide online course materials for a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms courses. It has been funded by two National Science Foundation grants: TUES program grant DUE-1139861 and EAGER program grant IIS-1258571.

  An instance of this book that we will be using for the course together with online practice exercises is hosted on Canvas.

  You should [self-enroll](https://canvas.instructure.com/enroll/GRGKT7) for the book access through Canvas, or sing-up for [Canvas account](https://canvas.instructure.com/register) and use the following join code: GRGKT7. <br>
  __You MUST use your NYU email address (with the netID in it) to get proper credit for completion of exercises.__

<!--
- __PeerWise__

  Students use PeerWise to create and to explain their understanding of course related assessment questions,
  and to answer and discuss questions created by their peers.

  To register go to [PeerWise](https://peerwise.cs.auckland.ac.nz), select your institution (i.e., New York University),
  in the lower right corner chose the option to register.

  You will need the following information ready to register:
  - Course ID: 21529 <br>
  - Your student identifier: your NYU netID (the one that appears in your default NYU email) <br>

  Select your username (it does not need to be your name and you can make it as anonymous as you wish) and password. Enter the above
  course ID and the student identifier.

  Once your account is created, you can log in (with the credentials that you picked above).

  How to use this tool: [A guide for students](https://peerwise.cs.auckland.ac.nz/docs/students/)

- __FlipGrid__

  We will use FlipGrid throughout the semester to collect short (1-2 minutes) video responses fromall students. In some cases these videos will
  be public to the entire class, in other cases they will be visible to the instructional stuff only.

  To sign up for out class go to [FlipGrid](https://flipgrid.com/f20cs102) and sign in with your NYU email account (which falls under the Google account).

  Record your first video: an introduction telling us who you are, why you are taking the class and a fun fact about yourself (just for fun).
-->

- __Ed__

  We will be using Ed as a discussion forum and for collaborative code editing. You should see an invitation to Ed in your email box soon. Once you have access, use that platform to ask any course-related questions: you can post questions publicly to the entire class or you can post them privately so only the instructional stuff will see them.
  If you did not get the invitation you can self enroll by using this [join link](https://us.edstem.org/join/).
