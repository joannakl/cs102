# Binary Search Tree (BST) Introduction

## BST

.left-column2[

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree with additional properties:

- the value stored in any node is greater than the values stored in its left child and all its descendants (or left subtree), and

- the value stored in any node is smaller than the value stored in its right child and all its descendants (or its right subtree).

- In many definitions of a BST, the duplicates are not allowed.
- In the cases where duplicates are allowed, they need to be consistently placed in one or the other subtree for the entire tree.

# BST Node

---

## BST Node

The node of a BST tree has a structure just like the binary tree node:

--

.left-column2[
```
class BSTNode <E> {

  E data;
  BSTNode <E> left;
  BSTNode <E> right;

  //constructors
  //and methods as needed
  ...
}
```
]

<img width="250px" alt="bst tree" src="img/11/bst-node.jpg">

--
.below-column2[

]
<br/><br/>
But Java generics also allow us to make sure that such a node (or later on the tree) can
only be instantiated with types that can be compared (otherwise we cannot determine
how the values should be placed in the tree).


---

## BST Node - take 1

.smaller[
```java

class BSTNode <T extends Comparable <T> > {

    private T data;
    private BSTNode <T> left;
    private BSTNode <T> right;

    public BSTNode ( T data ) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    public BSTNode (T data, BSTNode <T> left, BSTNode <T> right ) {
        this.data = data;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }

    ...

    //desired setters and getters

}

```
]

- `T` in this definition serves exactly the same role as `E` - any letter will do, in fact

- `T extends Comparable <T>` requires that the type used in the node will implement `Comparable<T>` interface

---

## BST Node - take 2

.smaller[
```java

class BSTNode <T extends Comparable <T> > implements Comparable < BSTNode<T> > {

    private T data;
    private BSTNode <T> left;
    private BSTNode <T> right;

    public BSTNode ( T data ) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    public BSTNode (T data, BSTNode <T> left, BSTNode <T> right ) {
        this.data = data;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }

    ...

    //desired setters and getters

    ...

    public int compareTo ( BSTNode <T> other ) {
        return this.data.compareTo ( other.data );
    }
}

```
]

- `implements Comparable < BSTNode<T> > ` makes the `BSTNode` class comparable
- the specific `compareTo` method allows us to  compare nodes instead of comparing values inside the node and the results
are the same


---

## BST Node - take 3

.smaller[
```java
class BST < T extends Comparable <T> > {

    ...

    private class BSTNode implements Comparable < BSTNode > {

        T data;
        BSTNode  left;
        BSTNode  right;

        public BSTNode ( T data ) {
            this.data = data;
        }

        public BSTNode (T data, BSTNode left, BSTNode right ) {
            this.data = data;
            this.left = left;
            this.right = right;
        }

        public int compareTo ( BSTNode other ) {
            return this.data.compareTo ( other.data );
        }
    }

    ...
}

```
]


- with the private inner class, `T extends Comparable <T> ` is required at the level
    of the class
- but we can still make the node comparable by implementing `Comparable<BSTNode>` interface

## `find` in a BST

Looking for a value in a BST should remind us of looking for a value using
a binary search algorithm for a sorted list: at every point we should be
able to make a decision _to go left_ or _to go right_ - once we make that decision
we never need to go back.

## `find` in a BST - Pseudocode

```

boolean find ( T data ) {
    return find ( data, root )
}

boolean find ( T data, BSTNode node )

    if node == null
        return false

    else if (  data < node.data )
        return find( data, node.data )

    else if (data > node.data )
        return find (data, node.data )

    else
        return true

## `remove` from a BST

There are three cases of removing a node from a BST:

--

- removing a leaf: disconnect it from the tree by setting its parent's reference to `null`

--

- removing a node with one child (one subtree): disconnect it from the tree by setting
its parent's reference to point to its only child (left or right does not matter)

--

- removing a node with two children (two subtrees):
    - find its inorder predecessor (or successor),
    - use that value to replace the value that we are removing
    - remove the value of the predecessor from the left subtree (or the value of the successor from the right subtree)


--

-----

In the last case, we need to be able to find an inorder predecessor or an inorder successor of a given value.

How can we do this?

--

.left-column2[
```
T getPredecessor ( BSTNode node )
    BSTNode current = node.left
    while (current.right != null )
        current = current.right
    return current.data
```
]
--

.right-column2[
```
T getSuccessor ( BSTNode node )
    BSTNode current = node.right
    while (current.left != null )
        current = current.left
    return current.data
```
]

template:section

# Examples and Things to Think About

---

## `min` and `max` for a BST

Provide an algorithm that finds and returns the smallest and the largest value in a
binary search tree.

__Challenging:__ provide an algorithm that returns n'th smallest value. You can assume that n is smaller
than the number of nodes in the tree.

---

## Iterative `find`

We looked at a recursive algorithm for the find  method.

Can you implement an equivalent method iteratively? Do you need additional data structure
to keep track of explored vs. unexplored branches? If so, which ones? If not, why not?

---

## Order of Adding

Does the order in which we add values to a tree changes its final shape?

For each of the ordering of the values, add them to an initially empty BST one by one:

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
- 6, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, 9, 10
- 5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 4, 8, 9, 10

Which of those trees are _better_? Why?

---

## Removing from a Tree

.left-column2-small[.smaller[
Consider the tree on the right.

For each of the following nodes specify which of the three procedures should be
followed to remove the node from a tree (i.e., is it a leaf, node with one child
or node with two children).
- 87
- 80
- 45
- 60
- 90
- 35
- 25
- 70
]]
.right-column2-large[
<img width="500px" alt="large BST" src="img/11/bst-large-46.jpg">
]

.below-column2[.smaller[
Show the tree after removing those nodes.
If the node has two children show both options: using predecessor and using successor values.

__In all cases start from the original tree.__
