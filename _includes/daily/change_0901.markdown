We will be using many different tools to facilitate course discussions, assessments, reviews, practice sessions, etc.
At the start of the semester you will need to sign up for several of these tools and resources:

__PeerWise__

Students use PeerWise to create and to explain their understanding of course related assessment questions,
and to answer and discuss questions created by their peers.

To register go to [PeerWise](https://peerwise.cs.auckland.ac.nz), select your institution (i.e., New York University),
in the lower right corner chose the option to register.

You will need the following information ready to register:
- Course ID: 21529 <br>
- Your student identifier: your NYU netID (the one that appears in your default NYU email) <br>

Select your username (it does not need to be your name and you can make it as anonymous as you wish) and password. Enter the above
course ID and the student identifier.

Once your account is created, you can log in (with the credentials that you picked above).
