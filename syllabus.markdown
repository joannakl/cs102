# Prerequisites
---

__Passing CSCI.UA.0101 with a grade of C or better.__

You are expected to know and remember the material from CSCI.UA.0101 course. If you took the course a few semesters ago
and/or do not remember parts of the material, start reviewing it during the summer/winter break.


__If you took an equivalent of this course at a different school, you need to make
sure that you are familiar with Java. We assume you know enough Java
to write fairly large programs right at the beginning of the semester.__


# Grading
---

Your grade will be based on:

* test/exams: online exams completed individually
* programming projects: several programming projects completed individually  
* problem sets:
	- weekly activities completed during recitations
    (individually or, preferably, in small groups)
	- creating answer keys for selected problems/activities
* quizzes: pop-quizzes given during lectures, **not announced**
* progress: completing assigned readings, tutorials, activities, etc.,  and answering
	embedded questions
* participation: taking active part in class discussions (asking and answering
	questions during lectures and on the course discussion forum), creating, answering
	and commenting on the review questions on PeerWise
(The exact distribution of how each of the above contributes to your grade will
	be determined prior to the start of the semester.)

Grades will be determined using the following scale:

        A 	95-100
        A- 	90-95
        B+ 	87-90
        B 	83-87
        B- 	80-83
        C+ 	76-80
        C 	72-76
        D 	65-72
        F 	less than 65


The grade of *Incomplete* is reserved for students who, for legitimate and documented reason, miss the final exam. The grade of *Incomplete* **will not be given** to student who started falling behind in class. Those students should withdraw from the class or switch to *Pass/Fail* option.

# Absences (excused and unexcused)
---

I generally do not take attendance, although, if you miss too many sessions, we will notice.

If you __miss an in-class quiz__ (for any reason), you will get a chance to make it up by writing a summary of the lecture
that you missed and submitting it for evaluation. You will need to watch the lecture recording and write a few paragraph long summary.

The exams can be made up only in case of an excused absence with appropriate documentation.

If you will miss an exam due to a religious observance, please familiarize yourself with [University Calendar Policy on Religious Holidays](https://goo.gl/e6NHDe) and talk to me well in advance to come up with alternative arrangements.

# Recitations
---

Recitations are the times to have most of your questions answered. These could be questions about upcoming projects,
material covered during the prior week or the weekly problem sets.

We will discuss the details of attendance and the in-person vs. remote mode of recitations for each week at the start of the semester.


# Weekly Problem Sets
---

Each week you will be given a problem set. You should review that problem set before
your weekly recitation so that you can discuss any questions and issues during the
recitation.

You are encouraged to work with other students on the problem sets. You can do that in a breakout room
during the scheduled recitation times. If you work on a problem set as a team, you should make a single submission
with all your names attached to it.

Once during the semester, you will be selected to be a _solution writer_. This means that in addition to submitting
your regular solutions for the given problem set, you will be in charge of preparing solutions that all other
students can access afterwards. You should work very closely with your recitation leader to make sure that your
published solutions are readable to other students, detailed and correct.  

The weekly problem sets can be retrieved any time during the week in which they are assigned but prior to the
recitation session for which you are registered. They are due 7 days (i.e., 7 time 24 hours) after you retrieved
them for the first time.


# Programming Projects
---

Programming projects will be given on
a regular basis. In general, they will be due 7-10 days after
they are assigned. They will require you to write and, often,
read and understand significant amount of code.

__The programming projects should be completed individually and they should be your own work.__  

*Late and missed programming projects:*

* For each project you will have a 5 hour buffer window after the due date.
You can submit or resubmit the project during this time without any point
penalty.
* The late project submissions lose 20% of their original score for each day they are
late. If the project has multiple parts, the late penalties apply to the entire project
not only the parts that are submitted late. If you submit the project 5-24 hours late,
the maximum score is 80 (instead of 100). If you submit the project 24-48 hours late, the maximum
score is 60 (instead of 100), etc.

*Broken programming projects:*

If you hand in a program that does not
compile or crashes when it is run, you will get a grade of zero on it.
As you are working on your code, make sure that it compiles and does what
you expect it to do. Test frequently, not only after you write hundreds of
lines of code. It makes more sense to comment out broken pieces of the code and
submit incomplete implementation of the project, instead of submitting a program
that does not compile or run.



__No programming projects can be accepted after the last day of classes.__


# Exams
---

There will be two or more exam-like assessments. The details of the format of those
will be posted before the start of the semester.

<!--

There will be a midterm and a final exam. All exams are cumulative.

**Missing an exam:** There will be no make-up exams. Failure to take an exam
counts as a zero grade on that exam. The only exception to this rule is for
students who have a legitimate serious medical or personal emergency (documented).
These students need to talk to me as soon as possible (trying to excuse an exam
absence a week after it happened will not work).

# Academic Integrity
---

This course follows the university and departmental policies on academic integrity:
- [Academic Integrity for Students at NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html)
- [CS Department Academic Integrity](http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity)

Our main philosophy is that you need to be honest and fair to yourself, other students
in the class and the instructional stuff.

We know that interactions with your classmates can facilitate deeper understanding
of the subjects and provide invaluable lessons. We also know that in the _real world_ large programming
projects and rarely implemented by individuals. Finally, we know that in the
_real world_ you are rarely asked to take timed exams and be graded on them.
But you are in the process of preparing for the real world, and you need to prove
to yourself and to others that you can be a valuable contributor to a group project or a team.

__All your work that is submitted for grading in this class has to be your own, unless
otherwise specified. If you receive any help from a human or use any non-human resources, you need
to acknowledge that in your submissions.__

__Regret clause__: If you violate the rules of academic integrity when submitting work
for this class, but bring it to the attention of the instructor within __48 hours of your submission__, we will impose only _local_ sanctions (i.e., failing or reduced grade on a given assignment), but we
will not refer your case for further disciplinary actions (except in the case
of repeated violations).



Here are examples of _fair_ and _not fair_ actions that a student may take. This is not an
exhaustive list and should serve as examples of behaviors rather than a complete
definition.

__Fair Actions__

- Working and completing a weekly problem set with other students and specifying the name
of all those involved as authors.
- Discussing problem sets and assignments with other students in a natural language
(i.e., English or any other spoken language, not Java) and acknowledging such discussions
in your submission.
- Discussing problem sets and assignments with tutors and instructional stuff and
acknowledging such discussions in your submission.
- Incorporating a short fragment of code (a few lines) that you find in the course
suggested resources or other online resources and acknowledging it in your submission.
- Sharing code with other students (possibly your classmates) that illustrates concepts
and techniques discussed in this course as long as this code is not a solution (or a partial solution)
to one of the assigned problems.


__Not Fair Actions__

- Working and completing a weekly problem set and adding names of students who did not
participate in the group work as authors.
- Splitting the problem set problems between multiple students and submitting as a group. (Each
member of the group has to participate in solving every problem.)
- Making your solutions available to others (publicly or privately) prior to the end of
the semester. (This includes posting solution on a discussion forum, in a public repository, etc.)
- Asking a classmate to see their solutions prior to the last date at which submissions are
accepted (this may be different than the due date).
- Guiding a classmate in their work by providing all or most of the details needed to produce a
solution.
- Failing to acknowledge any form of human help in the submission.
- Failing to acknowledge any non-human resources used in order to complete the submission.
- Asking any human (other than the instructional stuff) for help during an exam or a quiz.
- Looking at another student's work during an exam or a quiz.
- Submitting work that was completed by someone else for a problem set, a programming project
or an exam.
- Submitting work that was completed by someone else and then modified by your for a problem set,
a programming project or an exam.
