Project 1: Reading and understanding code. Due __Sept. 20, 11:55pm__. <br>
Familiarize yourself with the following code. The three files provide a simple implementation
of a color converter (CSS named colors, RGB values, hex-representation). Once you decide that you understand the
code (how it works, what it does, how the three classes interact, how the user interaction happens,
how the file I/O works, ...), you will take a quiz on NYU Classes that is based on the code. (For the purpose
of the quiz, you will use the line numbering in the PDF documents of the code, but you should use the
actual code to run it and experiment with it.)

- [zip file with the source code](hwk/project1_1.zip)
- [ColorConverter class - PDF](hwk/ColorConverter_java.pdf)
- [ColorList class - PDF](hwk/ColorList_java.pdf)
- [Color class - PDF](hwk/Color_java.pdf)
- input file: [color_list.txt](hwk/color_list.txt) - some of the questions in the quiz refer to this file

(The quiz will be available on NYU Classes at the end of this week.)
