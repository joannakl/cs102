## Race04

- Do you need to implement the comparable interface to sort the objects?
- Why `implements Comparable<RaceContender04>`?
- Why is RaceContender04’s move method set as abstract when the class itself is also set as abstract?- What is the point of sorting the array?
- Why specify this for the number but not the position in the object RaceContender contructors- How does RaceContender04 implement Comparable? How does that work?
- Why does printPosition create new lines?- Specifics regarding a comparable interface?
- What is Thread class?
- Why is `@Override` commented out- Why add “abstract” to “public void move()”?
- Why is there so much repeated code?
- Are there any disadvantages to keeping track of racers in an array?
- How does compareTo help sort the array in RaceContender04?
- Why use protected instance variables?
- How are the number of racers being determined (lines 28-33)?
- On line 76 - how does array.sort() work?- What does comparable mean?
- On line 66, why do we have to say that isOver=true if the while loop is already under that condition?- Why is RaceContender4 implementing itself?
