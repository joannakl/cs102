Reading: chapter 4 (concentrate on big-O, no proofs required
- although they will come in handy for the _Basic Algorithms_ course).

__Project 4__ (due date Oct. 30 at 11:55pm - __no grade period for this project__):

Familiarize yourself with the following code.
Once you decide that you understand the
code (how it works, what it does, how the particular abstract data types are
  implemented,   what the performance is, ...), you will take a quiz on NYU
  Classes that is based on the code. You should use the
  Javadoc documentation as well as the source code files for Java API that you
  downloaded at the beginning of the term. It is replicated for you in pdf and
  source code format below.

Classes that implement stack and queue ADTs in Java API:
- `ArrayDeque`: [pdf](hwk/ArrayDeque.java.pdf) [source code](hwk/ArrayDeque.java)
- `LinkedList`: [pdf](hwk/LinkedList.java.pdf) [source code](hwk/LinkedList.java)
- `Queue`: [pdf](hwk/Queue.pdf) [source code](hwk/Queue.java)
- `Stack`: [pdf](hwk/Stack.pdf) [source code](hwk/Stack.java)
- `Vector`: [pdf](hwk/Vector.pdf) [source code](hwk/Vector.java)
- Code provided as application examples for stack and queues in the textbook:
  - The source code for solving matching parentheses and HTML tags in section
6.1.5 in the textbook.
  - The source code for `Josephus` class in section 6.2.4 in the textbook.


(The quiz will be available on NYU Classes in a few days.)
