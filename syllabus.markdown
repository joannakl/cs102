## Course Description

This course covers use and design of data structures, which organize information in computer memory.
Topics covered include data structures (lists, stacks, queues, graphs, binary trees, binary search trees, hash tables),
how to implement them in a high-level programming language (Java), how to analyze their effect
on algorithm efficiency, and how to use and modify them.

***
## Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes

This section outlines the key knowledge and skills you'll acquire by successfully completing this course.
The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms,
emphasizing the underlying concepts so you can apply them in any programming language, not just Java,
even though the programming language we will use in this course is Java.
We will explore how to analyze and solve computational problems efficiently.

* **Course Objectives** <br>
By the end of this course, you will:

    * **Understand and analyze fundamental data structures:** Gain a deep understanding of core data structures,
    including lists, stacks, queues, graphs, trees, and hash tables. You'll learn the theory behind their design,
    their strengths and weaknesses, and their common use cases.
    * **Implement data structures in Java:** You'll build your own implementations of various data structures,
    using both array-based and reference-based approaches where applicable. This hands-on experience will solidify
    your understanding of how these structures work internally.
    * **Analyze algorithm efficiency:** Learn to evaluate the performance of algorithms using **Big-O notation** 
    to determine their time complexity. This skill is crucial for writing efficient and scalable code.
    * **Master key algorithms:** You'll learn and implement fundamental algorithms, including recursive algorithms,
    searching algorithms, and various sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort.
    * **Strengthen your Java programming skills:** We'll cover advanced Java concepts that are essential for
    data structures, such as **generics**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and the nuances of memory management
    (e.g., references vs. objects).

* **Learning Outcomes** <br>
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

    * **Choose the right data structure:** Analyze a given problem and select the most appropriate data structure to solve it efficiently.
    * **Implement data structures from scratch:** Write code to implement data structures like linked lists, binary search trees,
    and hash tables from the ground up, using any programming language. This demonstrates a conceptual mastery of the structures themselves,
    beyond their specific implementations in Java.
    * **Analyze algorithm performance:** Accurately determine the time complexity of a given algorithm or data structure operation.
    * **Apply recursion to problem-solving:** Design and implement recursive solutions for problems and understand how recursion works under the hood.
    * **Solve problems using graphs and trees:** Understand the structure and application of graphs and trees, and be able to implement basic graph algorithms.
    * **Use advanced Java features:** Confidently use generics, interfaces, and object-oriented principles to create robust and flexible code.
    * **Demonstrate a conceptual understanding:** Articulate the underlying principles of various data structures and algorithms,
    allowing you to discuss their trade-offs and adapt them to new contexts.

## Communication, Asking Questions, Getting Help

If you have questions related to the course materials or assessments:
- Ask them in lectures and recitations.
- Post them on the course discussion forum (Ed). The posts should be public unless they reveal part of the answer for a graded assessment.
- Visit the tutors during tutoring hours (available in-person and remotely at different times of the day)
- Visit instructors' office hours (schedule available on Brightspace)

If you have questions regarding your grades or some personal issues
- Post them as a private post on the discussion forum using the Ed platform. (Avoid emails as they often get lost in the stream of other things and you will not get a timely response.)
- Visit instructors' office hours (schedule available on Brightspace).


***
## Assessments and Grading

The grade for this course will be determined according to the following formula:

- **Participation and Progress (PaP), 10%** <br/>
This category will be assessed based on taking an active part in the course:
    - completing assigned readings, tutorials,
    activities, etc., and self-assessment exercises (lab assignments), 
    - regularly participating in recitations, and completing group and individual work, 
    - completing class polls and pop-quizzes during the lectures and recitations, 
    - participating in  class discussions 
    (asking and answering questions on the course discussion forum, reading posts made on
    the discussion forum by other students and instructors). 
    
    Several of these grades (about one fourth) will be dropped to account for   
    student absences due to late registration, illness, holiday observances, family/personal emergencies, or any other circumstances.
- **2 Exams: Midterm Exam, 15%  and  Final Exam, 25%**<br/>
Exams will be in-person and synchronous
(may be switched to online and/or asynchronous if the University makes such a decision), and completed individually.
No exam grades are dropped. All exams must be completed individually by you with no assistance of
any other people (except for the instructor and proctors) or technology.
Each exam has two parts with equal weight: paper-based part and coding part. Both parts are timed.
The coding part will be taken within Respondus lock-down browser. 
- **3-5 In-class Paper-Based Quizzes (PBQ), 15%** <br/>
The announced in-class quizzes will be taken during the lectures.
Each quiz will take approximately 20-minutes.
All in-class quizzes must be completed individually by you with no assistance of any other people  (except for the instructor and proctors) or technology. 
- **Several Programming Projects, 10%** <br/>
Several programming projects will be given during the semester. The programming projects should
be completed individually and they should be your own work (you are responsible for the code you submit).
The projects will be graded based on submission, passing autograder tests and code review. 
- **3-5 In-class Coding Quizzes (CQ), 15%** <br/>
The announced in-class programming quizzes will be taken during the recitations. 
You will need to solve a particular programming problem within 30 minutes. 
The problem will be similar to problems you have seen while completing labs and programming projects. 
These will be taken within Respondus lock-down browser. 
- **Several Code Reading Projects (CRP), 10%** <br/>
There will be a few code reading projects. In these projects you will be given a code base that solves a particular problem. 
You will have several days to study and understand the code, and ask questions regarding things you may not be familiar with. 
Finally, you will take a timed quiz during which you will need to answer questions about the code base. 


**Course Grade**

The final course grade will be assigned as follows:

Score | Letter Grade
-------|------------
95-100 | A
90-95 | A-
87-90 | B+
83-87 | B
80-83 | B-
76-80 | C+
72-76 | C
65-72 | D
< 65 | F

The grade of _Incomplete_ is reserved for students who miss the final exam or the last project after
completing all other coursework in the semester, and have a chance of passing the course once the final exam or the last programming project is completed (students need to request the grade of incomplete in the course on Albert). <br/>
The grade of _Incomplete_ **will not be given** to students who started falling behind in class for any reason.
Those students should withdraw from the course or switch to _Pass/Fail_ option.

## Recitations and Labs

### Recitations

Recitations are the times to have most of your questions answered. These could be questions about
upcoming projects, material covered during the prior week or the weekly labs. They are also a chance
for you to work with a group of students from the class to solve some problems from the weekly labs together.

The recitations are essential part of the course. You are expected to attend them.
They are a chance for you to learn the material and collaborate with your peers.
They are NOT optional part of this course.

### Weekly Labs

(Almost) every week you will be given a lab to work on. You should review the lab
instructions during your weekly recitation so that you can discuss any questions and issues during the recitation.

During some of the recitation session you will get a chance to work on parts of the
lab with other students and with guidance of the recitation instructor.

Some parts of the weekly labs will  be submitted and will contribute to the "participation and progress"
part of your grade for this course. To get the credit for this part, you must submit it before the due date. 
Some of the labs will be assessed based on completion, but most of the time, we will select part of the lab 
to be graded based on correctness. 


***
## Course Policies

This course follows CAS Academic Policies that can be found at
[https://bulletins.nyu.edu/undergraduate/arts-science/academic-policies/](https://bulletins.nyu.edu/undergraduate/arts-science/academic-policies/).



### Attendance

This is an in-person synchronous class and you are expected to attend all lectures and recitations.

Missing a class or two is reasonable and often unavoidable, but missing more than five course meetings will likely result in decreased understanding of the course content and, hence, lower scores.

If, for any reason, you need to miss a lot of class meetings, you should contact the instructor and the Dean of Students in your school for guidance on an extended absence period.
Extended absences often result in students inability to make-up missed material and assessments. You should consider withdrawing from the class and attempting it again in the future semester when you can
benefit from the course most and succeed in its completion.

### Missed Assessments

If you miss an assessment due to a religious observance, illness, family emergency, or any other reason beyond your control, you need to notify your instructor ahead of time (in case of a planned absence) or as soon as possible (in case of an unplanned emergency absence). Trying to excuse/explain the absence two weeks after it happened will not work.

- To account for any missed  in-class pop quizzes or polls, recitation attendance or lab assignments, several (approximately one fourth) lowest and missing scores in the participation and progress category will be dropped at the end of the semester. All reasons for missing something in this category are treated in exactly the same way: absence due to illness, religious observance, late registration, oversleeping or .... If you miss one of the assessments from this category, you do not need to notify us.

- If you miss one of the in-class paper-based quizzes (PBQs), the part of the grade based on PBQs will be based on the remaining ones. You need to notify Professor Klukowska about a missed PBQ, otherwise the grade for such a quiz will count as zero. <br/>
If you miss more than one PBQ, you need to discuss it with the instructor immediately. You will not be excused from more than one quiz for any reason.

- If you miss one of the in-class coding quizzes (CQs), the part of the grade based on CQs will be based on the remaining ones. You need to notify Professor Klukowska about a missed CQ, otherwise the grade for such a quiz will count as zero. <br/>
If you miss more than one CQ, you need to discuss it with the instructor immediately. You will not be excused from more than one quiz for any reason.

- If you miss one of the code reading projects, the part of the grade based on CRPs will be based on the remaining ones. You need to notify Professor Klukowska about a missed CRP, otherwise the grade for such a project will count as zero. <br/>
If you miss more than one CRP, you need to discuss it with the instructor immediately. You will not be excused from more than one quiz for any reason.

- If you miss either part of the midterm exam, the corresponding part of the final exam will be counted in its place. You should contact Professor Klukowska about a missed midterm exam right away, otherwise the grade 
may be counted as zero. 

- If you miss the final exam, you should request a grade of _incomplete_ for the course. You will need to take an alternative make-up exam at the start of the following regular semesters (either spring or fall) at the time and place chosen by the instructor. You can request a grade of _incomplete_ on Albert. 

- If you miss the due date for one of the programming projects, refer to the section below.

### Late Programming Projects

When you submit the programming project before the posted due date, you will receive 5 bonus points for that project.

Anybody can submit the code for the project for additional five days after the official due date. There will be no point deductions
for projects submitted within that five-day window. No submissions will be accepted after these additional five days pass.

The graders will start grading once all submissions are made. 

**No programming projects will be accepted after the last day of classes.**


### Broken Programming Projects

If you hand in a program that does not compile or crashes when it is run, you will get a grade of zero on it. As you are working on your code, make sure that it compiles and does what you expect it to do. Test frequently, not only after you write hundreds of lines of code. It makes more sense to comment out broken pieces of the code and submit an incomplete implementation of the project, instead of submitting a program that does not compile or run.



### Disability Disclosure Statement

New York University is committed to providing equal educational opportunity and participation for students of all abilities. We work with NYU students to determine appropriate and reasonable accommodations that support equal access to a world-class education.

Students requesting academic accommodations are advised to reach out to the Moses Center for Student Accessibility as early as possible in the semester for assistance.

Henry and Lucy Moses Center for Student Accessibility

Telephone: 212-998-4980

Website:[ http://www.nyu.edu/csd](http://www.nyu.edu/csd)

Email: [mosescsd@nyu.edu](mailto:mosescsd@nyu.edu)

Any student who requires academic accommodations should register with the Moses Center early in the semester so that we can provide these accommodations for the assessments. Students may not be able to receive proper accommodations if they register with the Moses Center within just a few days of the timed assessment. 

**In order to receive accommodations for assessments in this course, you need to request them at least seven days prior to such an assessment. Setting up accommodations and scheduling with Moses Center takes time.** 


### Wellness Statement

In a large, complex community like New York University, it's vital to reach out to others, particularly those who are isolated or engaged in self-destructive activities. Student wellness ([https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-programs/student-wellness.html](https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-programs/student-wellness.html)) is the responsibility of us all.

The NYU[ Wellness Exchange](https://www.nyu.edu/students/health-and-wellness/wellness-exchange.html) is the constellation of NYU’s programs and services designed to address the overall health and mental health needs of its students. Students can access this service 24 hours a day, seven days a week: [wellness.exchange@nyu.edu](mailto:wellness.exchange@nyu.edu); (212) 443-9999. Students may also call the Wellness Exchange hotline (212-443-9999) or the NYU Counseling Service (212-998-4780) to make an appointment for single session, short-term, or group counseling sessions.

### Generative AI Policy

The rise of generative AI tools like Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, and many others is fundamentally changing the landscape of computer science and beyond. Given their ubiquity, it is increasingly difficult to avoid their use. In this class, we will not ban these tools; instead, we will attempt to show you how to use them to your benefit rather than to your detriment.

Using AI to do all of your coding work for you will be a detriment to your learning. This approach will leave you unable to perform on exams, succeed in technical interviews, or be a reliable contributor on projects where you are expected to be an expert. True mastery in this field comes from a deep, hands-on practice and understanding of the material, not from effective prompting.

Instead, we encourage you to use AI as a learning partner, leveraging its capabilities in the following ways:

- AI as a Personal Tutor: When you're stuck on a concept, use AI to explain it in different ways. You can ask it to break down a difficult topic, provide more examples, or clarify why a particular solution works. Remember, however, that AI can "hallucinate" incorrect information; you are responsible for critically evaluating and verifying any information it provides. Sometimes it may be wiser and safer to visit instructors' office hours or tutoring hours to get help rather than relying purely on AI for such help. 
- AI as a Feedback Generator: Use AI to review your code and offer suggestions for improvement, just as a peer would. You can ask it to identify potential bugs, simplify complex sections, or suggest alternative approaches (but make sure to document such assistance, make sure that the suggested changes are correct and that you understand them).
- AI as a Partner in Peer Programming: Sometimes AI can be used effectively to speed up coding the ideas that you have. Come up with a detailed step by step algorithm and ask it to generate code that follows those steps exactly. 

Whenever you use AI tools in your learning, question the correctness of the results. It should be your learning partner and you need to know why certain data structures, algorithms and programming language features are used. You need to be able to explain the 
answers and code that it produces. 

Keep in mind that exams and other assessments in this class will not be given with access to AI tools, so you need to be able to write complete programs, implement parts of given programs, answer questions and suggest solutions to problems on your own without the help of any tools.

### Academic Integrity


This course follows the university and departmental policies on academic integrity:

-   [Academic Integrity for Students at NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html)
-   [CS Department Academic Integrity](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html "CS Department Academic Integrity")

Our main philosophy is that you need to be honest and fair to yourself, other students in the class and the instructional stuff.

We know that interactions with your classmates can facilitate deeper understanding of the subjects and provide invaluable lessons. We also know that in the _real world_ large programming projects are rarely implemented by individuals. Finally, we know that in the _real world_ you are rarely asked to take timed exams and be graded on them. But you are in the process of preparing for the real world, and you need to prove to yourself and to others that you can be a valuable contributor to a group project or a team.

**All your work that is submitted for grading in this class has to be your own, unless otherwise specified. If you receive any help from a human or use any non-human resources, you need to acknowledge that in your submissions.**

Here are examples of _fair_ and _not fair_ actions that a student may take. This is not an exhaustive list and should serve as examples of behaviors rather than a complete definition.

**Fair Actions**

-   Working and completing a weekly lab with other students and specifying the name of all those involved as authors (when submissions are expected).
-   Discussing problem sets and assignments with other students in a natural language (i.e., English or any other spoken language, not Java) and acknowledging such discussions in your submission.
-   Discussing problem sets and assignments with tutors and instructional stuff and acknowledging such discussions in your submission.
-   Incorporating a short fragment of code (a few lines) that you find in the course suggested resources or other online resources and acknowledging it in your submission.
-   Sharing code with others (possibly your classmates) that illustrates concepts and techniques discussed in this course as long as this code is not a solution (or a partial solution) to one of the assigned problems.

**Not Fair Actions**

-   Working and completing a weekly problem set and adding names of students who did not participate in the group work as authors (when submissions are expected).
-   Splitting the problem set problems between multiple students and submitting as a group. (Each member of the group has to participate in solving every problem.)
-   Making your solutions available to others (publicly or privately) prior to the end of the semester. (This includes posting solution on a discussion forum, in a public repository, emailing them to other students, etc.)
-   Asking a classmate to see their solutions prior to the last date at which submissions are accepted (this may be different than the due date).
-   Guiding a classmate in their work by providing all or most of the details needed to produce a solution.
-   Failing to acknowledge any form of human help in the submission.
-   Failing to acknowledge any non-human resources used in order to complete the submission.
-   Asking any human (other than the instructional stuff) for help during an exam or a quiz.
-   Looking at another student's work during an exam or a quiz.
-   Submitting work that was completed by someone else for a problem set, a programming project or an exam.
-   Submitting work that was completed by someone else and then modified by you for a problem set, a programming project or an exam.
-   Submitting work that was generated by a tool and then, possibly, modified by you for a problem set, a programming project or an exam.
