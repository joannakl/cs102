We will be using many different tools to facilitate course discussions, assessments, reviews, practice sessions, etc.
At the start of the semester you will need to sign up for several of these tools and resources:

__OpenDSA/Canvas__

OpenDSA is an open source project whose goal is to provide online course materials for a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms courses. It has been funded by two National Science Foundation grants: TUES program grant DUE-1139861 and EAGER program grant IIS-1258571.

An instance of this book that we will be using for the course together with online practice exercises is hosted on Canvas.

You should [self-enroll](https://canvas.instructure.com/enroll/GRGKT7) for the book access through Canvas, or sing-up for [Canvas account](https://canvas.instructure.com/register) and use the following join code: GRGKT7. <br>
__You MUST use your NYU email address (with the netID in it) to get proper credit for completion of exercises.__

__PeerWise__

Students use PeerWise to create and to explain their understanding of course related assessment questions,
and to answer and discuss questions created by their peers.

To register go to [PeerWise](https://peerwise.cs.auckland.ac.nz), select your institution (i.e., New York University),
in the lower right corner chose the option to register.

You will need the following information ready to register:
- Course ID: 21529 <br>
- Your student identifier: your NYU netID (the one that appears in your default NYU email) <br>

Select your username (it does not need to be your name and you can make it as anonymous as you wish) and password. Enter the above
course ID and the student identifier.

Once your account is created, you can log in (with the credentials that you picked above).
