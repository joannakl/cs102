1. if Jane Wong is on that page
    - get her number
1. otherwise

You are most likely going to tell me that this is not a very good algorithm,
but let's think about it for a while.

--

- Is the algorithm correct? (i.e., will it find Jane Wong in the phone book?)
--
 __YES__

--

- Is it efficient? (i.e., is this the fastest way of doing it?)
--
 __NO__

--

- Assuming that there are 1,000 pages in the phone book, how many page turns will it require?
--
 <br>__can't know for sure, but ~800-900__ (or 1000 if Jane is not listed)

--

- How about if there are 10,000 pages in the phone book? How many page turns will be needed?
--
<br>__again, can't know for sure, but ~8,000-9,000__ (or 10,000 if Jane is not listed)

---

template:Jane-take1-final

.yellowbox[
When the number of page turns is directly proportional to the total number of pages, we
are using a __linear__ algorithm to search for Jane.
]

--

More generally,

.yellowbox[
When the number of operations is directly proportional to the input size (generally denoted as `N`),
we are using a __linear__ algorithm. This is often described as an `O(N)` algorithm.
]

---

## Searching For Jane Wong (Take 2)

.pseudocode[
1. open the phone-book on page one
1. if Jane Wong is on that page
    - get her number
1. otherwise
    - __flip two pages__
    - go back to step 2
]

--

- Is the algorithm correct? (i.e., will it find Jane Wong in the phone book?)
--
 __NO__

--

    But we can fix it taking advantage of the fact that phone books are sorted.

---

## Searching For Jane Wong (Take 2.5)

.pseudocode[
1. open the phone-book on page one
1. if Jane Wong is on that page
    - get her number
1. otherwise
    - if the current page contains names _after_ Jane Wong
        - __go back one page__
        - go back to step two
    - otherwise
        - __flip two pages__
        - go back to step 2
]

--

- Is the algorithm correct? (i.e., will it find Jane Wong in the phone book?)
--
 __YES__

--

- Is it efficient? (i.e., is this the fastest way of doing it?)
--
<br> __NO__ (well, it is twice as fast as the _take 1_ algorithm, but we can do better)

--

- The number of page turns required by this algorithm is still directly proportional
to the number of pages, so it is still a __linear algorithm__.

name:Jane-take3

## Searching For Jane Wong (Take 3)

This is the algorithm that most people would follow (well, approximately).

.pseudocode[
1. &nbsp;
    - &nbsp;
1. open the phone-book to the middle page
{{content}}

]

--
1. if Jane Wong is on that page
    - get her number
{{content}}

--
1. otherwise, if the page contains names _after_ Jane Wong
    - tear the phone book in half
    - throw out the second half (including the page you just looked at)
    - go back to step 1
{{content}}

--
1. otherwise, if the page contains names _before_ Jane Wong
    - tear the phone book in half
    - throw out the first half (including the page you just looked at)
    - go back to step 1

--

What is the missing first step?

## Searching For Jane Wong (Take 3)

This is the algorithm that most people would follow (well, approximately).

.pseudocode[
1. if there is no phone-book left
    - Jane Wong is not listed, can't get her number
1. open the phone-book to the middle page
1. if Jane Wong is on that page
    - get her number
1. otherwise, if the page contains names _after_ Jane Wong
    - tear the phone book in half
    - throw out the second half (including the page you just looked at)
    - go back to step 1
1. otherwise, if the page contains names _before_ Jane Wong
    - tear the phone book in half
    - throw out the first half (including the page you just looked at)
    - go back to step 1
]

--

- Is the algorithm correct? (i.e., will it find Jane Wong in the phone book?)
--
 __YES__

--

- Is it efficient? (i.e., is this the fastest way of doing it?)
--
 __YES__ (although we won't prove it)

--

- Assuming that there are 1,000 pages in the phone book, how many page turns will it require?
--
 <br>__at most 10__

--

- How about if there are 10,000 pages in the phone book? How many page turns will be needed?
--
<br>__at most 14__

name:halving

## Power of Halving

.left-column2[
The significant performance improvement in this algorithm comes from halving the number of pages
that we need to look at after we examine each page.
- in _take 1_ and _take 2.5_ the number of pages that we eliminated was 1 or 2
- in _take 3_ the number of pages that we eliminate is equal to the half of the remaining pages

<div style="margin:-200px 0 0 0">
.left-column2[
.yellowbox[
When the search space decreases by half after each comparison, the algorithm is said to be __logarithmic__.
It is growing proportionately to the logarithm of the input size `N`. Such an algorithm is said to be
`O(log N)`.

.center80[.center[
<img alt="plot of N, N/2 and logN" src="img/03/logN_N-2.png" width=600px />

For a fixed value of `N=25`, the time that a logarithmic algorithm takes is much smaller than
the time taken by a linear algorithm.

(This may not always be true for very small values of `N`, but it always becomes true as `N` grows.)
]]

template:compare-plots

.center80[.center[
<img alt="plot of N, N/2 and logN" src="img/03/logN_N-3.png" width=600px />

As we double the `N = 50`, the time taken by a linear algorithm doubles, but the time taken by a logarithmic algorithm
barely increases.

### Group Discussion: What do you think are some applications of a binary search algorithm (take 3 in our phone-book search)?


- In breakout rooms of 3-4 people discuss some applications in which the binary search
algorithm might be useful.

- You should come up with 2-3 different applications. Try to think outside of the proverbial box.

- After 5-10 minutes, some groups will get a chance to report on what
they came up with.
