Q&amp;A for the final exam.

Come with questions.

<!--
__Topics to review for the final__:

- advanced Java topics
   - inheritance and polymorphism
   - interfaces and abstract classes
   - exception handling
   - generics
- lists (array based and reference based implementation)
- stacks and queues (array based and reference based implementation)
- recursion
- general trees (node structure, abstract view of the tree and the actual
 linkage between nodes, implementation of methods that traverse all or part
 of the tree)
- binary trees
- priority queue, heap (how it works, no implementation)
- search trees
   - binary search tree
   - AVL trees
- iterators for lists and trees
- sort algorithms: mergesort, quicksort,  heapsort)
- basics of hash tables (how it works, no implementation)
- performance results for all the discussed data structures and algorithms,
big-O notation


__Book sections that you are responsible for__:

(Note, there may be parts in these sections that we did not discuss in class explicitly, or
for which we used a different implementation.)

- chapter 1: all sections
- chapter 2: all sections
- chapter 3: all sections
- chapter 4: only parts related to big-O notation, no proofs
- chapter 5: sections 2 through 5
- chapter 6: sections 1, 2
- chapter 7: sections 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
- chapter 8: all sections (skip array-based representation of binary tree, and breadth-first traversal)
- chapter 9: sections 1-3 (you are not responsible for knowing how to implement it, but you should
be able to read the code that implements it)
- chapter 11: section 1
- chapter 12: sections 1, 2
- chapter 10: sections 1, 2 (very lightly)
