# Prerequisites
---

__Passing CSCI.UA.0101 with a grade of C or better.__

You are expected to know and remember the material from CSCI.UA.0101 course. If you took the course a few semesters ago
and/or do not remember parts of the material, start reviewing it during the summer/winter break.


__If you took an equivalent of this course at a different school, you need to make
sure that you are familiar with Java. We assume you know enough Java
to write fairly large programs right at the beginning of the semester.__


# Grading
---

Your grade will be based on:

* exams (65%): one midterm exam (25%) and the final (40%),  
* programming projects (25% total)
* recitation activities (5%), quizzes  (5%)
    * activities will be completed during recitations
    (usually in small groups) - you cannot get credit for these unless you are in the recitation
    * pop-quizzes will be given during lectures and recitations, **not announced** - no make-up quizzes will be given  

Grades will be determined using the following scale:

        A 	95-100
        A- 	90-95
        B+ 	87-90
        B 	83-87
        B- 	80-83
        C+ 	76-80
        C 	72-76
        D 	65-72
        F 	less than 65


The grade of *Incomplete* is reserved for students who, for legitimate and documented reason, miss the final exam. The grade of *Incomplete* **will not be given** to student who started falling behind in class. Those students should withdraw from the class or switch to *Pass/Fail* option.

# Absences (excused and unexcused)
---

I generally do not take attendance.

__The missed quizzes and recitation activities cannot be made up__. Two lowest scores on quizzes and two lowest scores on recitation activities will be dropped at the end of the
semester. This is to account for any excused (illness, holidays, job interviews, ...) or unexcused absences.

The exams can be made up only in case of an excused absence with appropriate documentation.

If you will miss an exam due to a religious observance, please familiarize yourself with [University Calendar Policy on Religious Holidays](https://goo.gl/e6NHDe) and talk to me well in advance to come up with alternative arrangements.

# Recitations
---

Recitations for the course are used to answer your questions regarding the material and posted projects.

During recitations you will also get some hands on practice by participating in group activities.
It may be a good idea to bring a laptop to recitations
(although it is not a requirement since you will only need one laptop per group).


# Assignments
---

**Programming projects (25% of your final grade)** will be given on
a regular basis. In general, they will be due 7-10 days after
they are assigned. They will require you to write and, often,
read and understand significant amount of code.

*No programming projects can be accepted after the last day of classes.*

*Late and missed programming projects:*

For each project you will have a 5 hour buffer window after the due date.
You can submit or resubmit the project during this time without any point
penalty.
The late project submissions lose 20% of their original value for each day they are
late. If you submit the project 5-24 hours late, the maximum score is 80
(instead of 100). If you submit the project 24-48 hours late, the maximum
score is 60 (instead of 100), etc.

*Broken programming projects:*<br> If you hand in a program that does not
compile or crashes when it is run, you will get a grade of zero on it.
As you are working on your code, make sure that it compiles and does what
you expect it to do. Test frequently, not only after you write hundreds of
lines of code. It makes more sense to comment out broken pieces of the code and
submit incomplete implementation of the project, instead of submitting a program
that does not compile or run.

**Do not hand-in homeworks (DNHI)** are given to encourage you to
practice the material that we discuss in class. The problem sets  and list of problems
from the book that you should be looking at are listed under the _Daily_ tab
of this page.  You should use these problems also as a review and practice for the exams as well. <br>

Recitations and Piazza posts are good places to have those problems discussed!



# Exams
---

There will be a midterm and a final exam. All exams are cumulative.

**Missing an exam:** There will be no make-up exams. Failure to take an exam
counts as a zero grade on that exam. The only exception to this rule is for
students who have a legitimate serious medical or personal emergency (documented).
These students need to talk to me as soon as possible (trying to excuse an exam
absence a week after it happened will not work).




# Academic Integrity Policy
---

We use [MOSS](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/)
(a system for detecting software plagiarism) to make sure that the
submitted assignments are not duplicates of one another. Your code
has to be your own.


I follow the department's
[academic integrity rules](http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity).

In short, it is fine to talk to other students about your ideas and your
programs, but it is not fine to work together on
assignments or copy someone else's assignment. You cannot copy other people's
work without giving them a proper credit (and part of your grade).<br>
Any sharing or copying of assignments will be considered cheating.
By the rules of the College of Arts and Science, I am required to report any
incidents of cheating to the department. <br>
If you have any doubt if something that you are doing qualifies as academic
dishonesty, talk to me!
<br>

*So what is cheating?*

* Sharing code/solutions: by copying, retyping, looking at, guiding, or supplying
a file (this includes posting partial or complete solutions on the course
discussion board, a public repository - for example GitHub, or any place where
others can access it)
* Coaching: helping your friend to write their code line by line of describing in
detail your own approach to the solution (send them to the tutors or office hours,
if you want to help them)
* Copying code from previous course or from elsewhere on WWW.
You are only allowed to use code from the textbook and what we supply on the
course website. These code fragments should be attributed to their original authors.
* Hiring someone to complete your assignments for you.


*What is NOT cheating?*

* Explaining how to use systems or tools
* Helping others with high-level design issue

---

polymorphism, generics, iterators, exception handling, file I/O
