# Searching

---

## Searching in Unorganized Array

When we do not know anything about organization of the data in an array, it is
hard to predict where we should start the search in order to find the elements
as fast as possible.
__Moreover, if the element is not in the array, we cannot decide that until
we check every single potential location.__

--

The algorithm that sequentially checks every location in the array is called __linear search__:
it starts at the beginning of the array and proceeds through to the array one element at a time
until either it finds what we are looking for, or reaches the end of the array.

---


## Linear Search - source code

Here is the Java source code for linear search algorithm in an array of type `int`:

``` Java
int linearSearch(int[] A, int key) {
  for (int i=0; i < A.length; i++)
    if (A[i] == key)          // if we found it return this position
       return i;
  return -1;                // otherwise, return -1
}
```

The search in an array of type `double` would look practically identical, except
for the names of the types in the signature of the above method.

---



## Linear Search - source code

If we are searching for an element in an unsorted array of objects
(not primitive type variables), then we can no longer use `==` operator for
comparing elements.
Instead, the use of  `equals()` method is required.

Note: unless the class overrides the `equals()` method defined in the `Object` class,
the inherited method does exactly the same comparison as `==` would.

--

``` Java
int linearSearch(Point[] points, Point p) {
    if ( p == null )
        return -1;
    for (int i=0; i < points.length; i++)
        if ( p.equals(points[i]) )          // if we found it return this position
        return i;
    return -1;                // otherwise, return -1
}
```

---

## Binary Search


If we know that the array is sorted, we can take advantage of it in the search
for an element. There is a particular location where  any item is expected to be.
If it is not there, then it cannot be anywhere else. Having a sorted array,
allows us to find the item much faster if it is located in the array, and to quickly
declare that it is not there, if that's the case.
(Well, assuming that we use an algorithm that takes advantage of that fact.)

You most likely have seen an algorithm called __binary search__.
At each step it eliminates half of the remaining items in the array
(unlike linear search which eliminated a single item in each step).

The general outline of the binary search algorithm follows. Assume that `key` is
the element that we are searching for.

.center80[
1. If the array is not empty, pick an element in the middle of the current array. Otherwise, go to step 5.
1. If that element is smaller than the `key`, discard all elements in the left
half of the array and go back to step 1.
1. If that element is greater than the `key`, discard all elements in the right
half of the array and go back to step 1.
1. If that element is equal to the `key`, return its index.
1. If the array is empty, the `key` is not there.
]

---

## Iterative Binary Search

The following code provides iterative solution to the binary search algorithm.
It is designed for the `Point` class.


```java
int binSearchIterative( Point[] points, Point p) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = points.length - 1;
    int mid;

    while ( left <= right ) { //array is not empty
        mid = (left+right) / 2;
        if (0 > points[mid].compareTo(p) )       //mid element is smaller than p
        left = mid+1;                          //discard left half
        else if ( 0 < points[mid].compareTo(p) ) //mid element is larger than p
        right = mid-1;                         //discard right half
        else
        return mid;                            //found it, return the index
        }

    return -1;          //did not find it, return -1
}
```
<br>

Note: this code does not have any error handling regarding the arguments.

---


## Recursive Binary Search

Here is a recursive implementation of the same algorithm.

.smaller[
```java
int binSearchRecursive( Point[] points, Point p, int left, int right) {

    if (left > right )  // no array left
        return -1;

    int mid = (left + right ) / 2;
    int compare = p.compareTo(points[mid]);

    if ( compare < 0 )  {       // mid element is larger than p
        right = mid - 1;
        return binSearchRecursive ( points, p, left, right);
    }
    else if (compare > 0 ) {    // mid element is smaller than p
        left = mid + 1;
        return binSearchRecursive ( points, p, left, right);
    }
    else {                      // mid is the
        return mid;
    }
}
```
]

--

Since the recursive calls need to be started with extra information about the `left` and `right` indexes,
we need a wrapper method that will setup the recursion:

.smaller[
```java
int binSearchRecursive( Point[] points, Point p) {
    if (points == null ) throw new NoSuchElementException("array is null");
    if (p == null) return -1;
    int left = 0;
    int right = points.length - 1;
    int mid;
    return binSearchRecursive( points, p, left, right);
}
```
]
---

## Performance of Search Algorithms

If the array has `N` items how many locations will be accessed by  linear search and binary search?

.center80[

|  | linear search | binary search |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|best case | 1 | 1 |
|worst case | N | log N |
|average case| <= N | <= logN |

]

--

As before, we are going to describe the performance using the Big-O notation so
that we do not need to worry about the actual constants.

.center80[

|  | linear search | binary search |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|best case | O(1) | O(1) |
|worst case | O(N) | O(log N) |
|average case| O(N) | O(log N) |

# Sorting
## Using Quadratic (or Slow) Algorithms

---

## Quadratic Sorts


In the previous course you should have seen at least one sorting algorithm. We will quickly
review three most popular quadratic sorts, and then move on to more efficient sort techniques.

--

----


What are some of the sort algorithms that were covered in previous classes?

--

- bubble sort
- selection sort
- insertion sort

---

## Bubble Sort

__Bubble sort__ is one of the first algorithms for sorting that people come up with.

If we want to sort the array from smallest to largest, we can simply go through it,
look at the elements pairwise and if the first in
the pair is smaller than the second one, swap them. We may need to repeat the passes
through the array up to
`n` times (assuming there are `n` elements in the array) before the whole array is in sorted order.

--

The following code implements bubble sort for an array of type `double`.

```java
  void bubbleSort(double[] list) {
    double tmp;
    for (int i = 0; i < (list.length - 1); i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < list.length - i - 1; j++) {
        //for each pair of elements, swap them, if they are out of order
        if (list[j] > list[j + 1])
        {
          tmp = list[j];
          list[j] = list[j + 1];
          list[j + 1] = tmp;
        }
      }
    }
  }
```


Bubble sort happens to be the slowest of the sorting algorithms discussed here. It is hardly ever used in practice.

---

## Selection Sort

__Selection sort__ is a sorting algorithm that
starts by finding the smallest item on the list and then swaps it with the first element of the list.
Then it finds the smallest element in the remaining list (ignoring the first one) and swaps it with the
second element on the list. It continues until the remaining unsorted part of the list is empty.

--

The following code implements Selection Sort for an array of type `double`.

```java
public static void selectionSort(double[] list) {

  for (int i = 0; i < list.length - 1; i++) {
    // find the minimum in the list[i...list.length-1]
    double currentMin = list[i];
    int currentMinIndex = i;
    for (int j = i + 1; j < list.length; j++) {
      if (currentMin > list[j]) {
        currentMin = list[j];
        currentMinIndex = j;
      }
    }
    // swap list[i] with list[currentMinIndex] if necessary;
    if (currentMinIndex != i) {
      list[currentMinIndex] = list[i];
      list[i] = currentMin;
    }
  }
}
```
---

## Insertion Sort

__Insertion sort__ algorithm
divides the array (just in theory) into a sorted part and unsorted part. Initially, the
sorted part consists only of the first item in the array (well, if we have only one thing,
it has to be in a sorted order). The unsorted part starts as all the remaining elements.
The algorithm works by repeatedly picking the first item from the unsorted part and inserting
it into the sorted part. Once the unsorted part is empty, the entire array is sorted.

--

The following code implements Insertion Sort for an array of type `double`.

```java
public static void insertionSort(double[] list) {
  for (int i = 1; i < list.length; i++) {
    // insert list[i] into a sorted sublist list[0..i-1] so that
    // list[0..i] is sorted
    double currentElement = list[i];
    int k;
    for (k = i - 1; k >= 0 && list[k] > currentElement; k--) {
      list[k + 1] = list[k];
    }

    // insert the current element into list[k+1]
    list[k + 1] = currentElement;
  }
}
```

---
## Performance of Quadratic Sorts


<br><br>
How many operations does it take to sort an array using one of the methods in this section?

--
<br><br>

The title of this section ("Quadratic Sorts") really gives it away. But how can we tell that the
performance (on average and in the worst case) is $O(n^2)$?

--

- Each of those methods
has two nested for loops. At least one of those for loops repeats  `n` or `n-1` times.

- The inner for loops repeat fewer than `n` times, but on average around `n/2` times.

- This gives us
number of operations that is proportional to $O(n^2)$, hence the name of this section.

# Sorting
## with MergeSort, `$O(n\log_2 n)$`, Algorithm

---


## Merge Sort

The merge sort algorithm is based on a very simple observation:

-  If we have `n` elements in the array, it takes approximately $n^{2}$ operations
to sort that array using the algorithms that we know so far.

--

-  If we divide the original array into two halves and then sort the two halves separately,
it takes approximately $2\times\left(\dfrac{n}{2}\right)^{2}$ or $\dfrac{n^{2}}{2}$ operations
to sort each half. Merging two halves can be done in time proportional to `n`. The whole process
ends with fewer operations than sorting the whole array.

--

It turns out that if we keep subdividing the array into smaller and smaller parts, we can complete
the sorting in time proportional to $n log_2 n$ , or $O(n \log_2 n )$ -
this is much faster than $O ( n^2 )$.

--
<br>

The __algorithm for merge sort__ is as follows:
-  split the array in half
-  sort the left half
-  sort the right half
-  merge two sorted half-arrays into a single sorted array

--

What do you think will be used for the second and third steps?

---

## Merge Sort <br>is a Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm


The merge sort algorithm is a __divide-and-conquer algorithm__. It takes a large problem and subdivides
it into smaller problems. If they are not small enough for immediate solution, it subdivides the smaller
problems into even smaller problems, etc.

---

## Merging Two Sorted Arrays

It turns out that the "most complicated" part of the implementation is in the merging of two sub-arrays.
They should be approximately the same size, but may be off by 1 or so.

--

.small[.red[The first version of the code that we write will need some revisions, but for now, let's just assume
that we are writing a method that takes two sorted arrays and returns another array that contains all
the elements of the two parameter arrays in sorted order.]]

--

```
  merge ( array1, array2 )
    create arrayMerged whose size equals (size of array1 + size of array2)
    set index1 to zero (first index in array1)
    set index2 to zero (first index in array2)
    set indexMerged to zero
    while index1 < size of array1   AND  index2 < size of array2
      if array1[index1] < array2[index2]
        set arrayMerged[indexMerged] to array1[index1]
        increment index1
      else
        set arrayMerged[indexMerged] to array2[index2]
        increment index2
      increment indexMerged
    copy remaining elements from array1 to arrayMerged
    copy remaining elements from array2 to arrayMerged
    return arrayMerged
```

--

<br/>
This merges two arrays into a single large array. It does not modify the original
arrays and allocates new space for the merged array. For the purpose of merge step
used in merge sort, we want to avoid using new memory to store and return the merged
array. We do not need the original arrays once we merge them, so it would be nice to be
able to reuse all that space.

---

## Merging Two Sorted Arrays

The version of merge method that we use in the merge sort __does not__ actually take
two separate arrays as parameters.



It operates on a single array and the __two sorted
parts__ are just specific ranges of indexes in that array.

```
              -----------------------------------------
      index   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
              -----------------------------------------
      value   | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 |10 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 |
              -----------------------------------------
```

--

In the above array,
indexes 0 - 4 contain _one sorted array_ and the indexes 5 - 9 contain _another sorted array_.


```
          ---------------------   ---------------------
   index  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |   | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
          ---------------------   --------------------
   value  | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 |10 |   | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 |
          ---------------------   ---------------------
```
--

We would like to merge these two sub-arrays so that all the data stays in the same array.



---

## Merging Two Sorted Arrays

Here is the pseudocode that does it.

It assumes that the two ranges
- `[leftFirst, leftLast]`, and
- `[rightFirst, rightLast]`
are adjacent and sorted.

--

```
merge ( array, leftFirst, leftLast, rightFirst, rightLast )
  create tmp array whose size equals (rightLast - leftFirst + 1 )
  set indexLeft to leftFirst
  set indexRight to rightFirst
  set index to zero
  while indexLeft <= leftLast   AND  indexRight <= rightLast
    if array[indexLeft] < array[indexRight]
      set tmp[index] to array[indexLeft]
      increment indexLeft
    else
      set tmp[index] to array[indexRight]
      increment indexRight
    increment index
  copy elements in range indexLeft-leftLast to tmp
  copy elements in range indexRight-rightLast to tmp
  copy tmp to array starting at leftFirst
```

--

<br/>
We used `tmp` array to store the sorted array, but once the method terminates the array is no
longer referenced and will be removed by Java garbage collector (or some other memory management system).


---

## Splitting the Array in Half


The __algorithm for merge sort__:
-  split the array in half
-  sort the left half
-  sort the right half
-  merge two sorted half-arrays into a single sorted array

--

The second version of merge method operates on a single array to save space. This suggests that
when we are "splitting" the array, we should not really create duplicate arrays in memory, but
rather decide what the ranges of each half-array should be.

---

## Recursion in Merge Sort



The __algorithm for merge sort__:
-  split the array in half
-  sort the left half
-  sort the right half
-  merge two sorted half-arrays into a single sorted array

--

So far we discussed the steps 4 and 1 from the merge sort algorithm.

Steps 2 and 3 are recursively
calling the merge sort on smaller sub-arrays. This guarantees that the recursion will eventually end,
but when?

--

What should be the base case for the recursion?

- Once the sub-arrays on which recursive call
is made have only one element remaining, there is nothing to split and sort recursively.
- This gives
the base case for recursive calls: we keep splitting the array into smaller and smaller pieces until
we cannot split any more.


---

## Merge Sort Pseudocode

The final step is to specify pseudocode for merge sort based on the algorithm mentioned before.
We want to take into account all the details discussed in the previous slides. As with many
recursive problems we will make use of a helper method that calls a recursive method.

--

Pseudocode for merge sort:

```
mergeSort( array )
  mergeSortRec (array, 0, array.length-1)
```

--
<br/>

```
mergeSort ( array, firstIndex, lastIndex )
  //base case
  if (firstIndex >= lastIndex)
    return
  //split the array
  mid = (firstIndex+lastIndex)/2
  mergeSortRec(array, firstIndex, mid)
  mergeSortRec(array, mid+1, lastIndex)
  merge( array, firstIndex, mid, mid+1, lastInd)
```


---

## Merge Sort Visualization

OpenDSA website has a very good visualization of step by step application of the merge sort
algorithm to a numerical array. You can find it at
\url{https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Books/Everything/html/Mergesort.html}.


---

## Merge Sort Performance

The actual work in mergesort algorithm is done by merge method. The merge method itself
takes time proportional to the number of elements in the two sub-arrays that it is merging.

--

When we split the original array of `n` elements into two sub-arrays and then need to merge
the sorted sub-arrays, the merge takes time proportional to `n`, or in Big-O notation $O(n)$.

--

How about all the smaller parts?

--

Each of the recursive calls (that is applied to the first half and the second half of the
original array) merges sub-arrays of total length approximately $\frac{n}{2}$ and since
there are $2$ such calls, the time it takes is proportional to $2\times\frac{n}{2}$ or `n`.

--

One level deeper, we have four recursive calls. Each of them merges sub-arrays of total length
of approximately $\frac{n}{4}$, so the time it takes is proportional to $4\times\frac{n}{4}$ or `n`.

--

Do you see the pattern?

--

Now, the question is how many times will this process repeat?
- How many times can we divide `n`
elements in half, and then divide each of those halves in half, etc, before we end up with one
element "halves"? The answer to that is $\log_{2}n$.

--

__At each level of recursion we perform $O(n)$ operations. There are `$\log_{2}n$`
levels of recursion. The entire merge sort takes `$O(n\log_{2}n)$` steps.__

--

__This is the best,
average and worst case time performance of merge sort.__

# Sorting
## with Quick Sort, `$O(n\log_2 n)$`, Algorithm

---

## Quick Sort

Quick sort is another algorithm that uses the __divide-and-conquer approach__.
- But the way
in which the array is divided is different.
- The dividing step of quick sort ends up
performing more operations than the one of merge sort, but it allows us to skip the
merging step at the end.

--

The idea behind the quick sort is the following.
- Pick a value, called __pivot__,
from the array and

--

- __partition__ the array by moving all the values smaller than
the pivot to the left and all the values larger than the pivot to the right.

--

- Then place
the pivot between the two parts. In the ideal situation, we pick the pivot to be as close
to the median of all the values in the array as possible.

--

- Once we have the two parts, we use quick sort again to sort the two parts.
<br>__Notice that after the partitioning step, the pivot
is in its final location.__

---


## Quick Sort

The __algorithm for quick sort__ is as follows:

-  pick a pivot
-  partition the array into two parts:

  -  left - containing all values less than the pivot
  -  right - containing all values grater than the pivot

-  apply quick sort to the left part
-  apply quick sort to the right part

---

## Picking a Pivot

Selecting a good pivot is necessary for guaranteeing a good performance. Imagine
that we always pick the smallest or the largest element to be the pivot.
In this scenario we end up with one of the parts containing all but one element
from the original array and the other part empty. You may guess that this is not
very desirable.

--

Picking the pivot also has to be quick.

--

There are several ways pivots are picked. All of them have their advantages and
disadvantages. Here are just a few ideas of how we can select a pivot.

-  always pick the first element from the given array (or sub-array)
-  pick a middle element in the array
-  pick a random element from the array
-  select three elements from the array and use their median as the pivot; the three elements could be
  -  first three elements in the array
  -  first, middle and last elements in the array
  -  random three elements in the array

---

## Partitioning the Array

Once we decide on the pivot, we need to partition the array into two parts.

The goal is to do it using as few operations as possible.

We do not care about
the order of elements in each part, just so that
- the left part has elements
smaller than the pivot, and
- the right part has elements larger than the pivot.

--

The following pseudocode is one way of performing partitioning. We want to partition
the `array` given the beginning index `left` and the end index `right`, and the index of the `pivot`.

```
  //move the pivot to the rightmost position
  swap array[right] and array[pivot]
  set pivot to right
  set right to right - 1
  while left <= right
  while array[left] < array[pivot]
    left ++
  while right >= left AND array[right] >= array[pivot]
    right --
  if right > left
    swap array[left] with array[right]
  //move the pivot to its final location
  swap array[left] with array[pivot]
  return left
```

---


## Recursion in Quick Sort

The recursive calls to quick sort continue as long as we have parts with more
than one element. The complete pseudocode for the quick sort follows.

```
quickSort ( array )
    quickSortRec( array, 0, array.size - 1 )
```
<br/>

```
quickSortRec (array, left, right)
  pivotIndex = findpivot(array, left, right)  //use any method
  newPivotIndex = partition ( array, left, right, pivotIndex )
  if ( newPivotIndex - left > 1 )
    quickSortRec( array, left, newPivotIndex - 1 )
  if ( right - newPivotIndex > 1 )
    quickSortRec( array, newPivotIndex + 1, right )

```
---

## Quick Sort Visualization


OpenDSA website has a very good visualization of step by step application of
the quick sort algorithm to a numerical array. You can find it at
\url{https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Books/Everything/html/Quicksort.html}.



---


## Quick Sort Performance

If we could always pick a pivot so that the two parts are approximately equal,
then the quick sort would perform `$O(n\log_{2}n)$` operations
(best, worst and average case).

--

But in extreme cases when we always pick a bad pivot,
the quick sort may deteriorate to `$O(n^{2})$` operations (worst case).

# Examples and Things to Think About

---

## Recursive Selection Sort

For the purpose of practicing your newly acquired expertise on recursion,
rewrite the selection sort using recursion.

In the first version, eliminate the outer loop and replace it with recursive calls.

Can you think of how to replace the inner loop with recursion as well?

---

## Quadratic Sorts for Objects

Rewrite all of the quadratic sort implementations so that they work
for reference types. Your functions should be generic and should
expect that the type used in place of `E` implements `Comparable<E>` interface.
