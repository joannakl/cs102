## `ArrayList<E>` as an Example of Array Based Implementation of a List

Instead of creating our own implementation that is based on an array, we will look
at the existing one implemented in Java: `ArrayList<E>` class.

--

- What makes this approach different from a linked lists approach?

    - the data is stored in an array instead of in nodes

--

- `ArrayList<E>` = an array (that can store any type of data) + operations that make everything easy

--

.center80[

.box[
Where did the pirate store his loot?
- In an ArrayList, because ArrayLists can grow!

.right[Dana L., 2018]
]]

--

- So how do they grow? And can we make it efficient?

# Growing the Array

## Growing the Array

Adding to the end of an array is O(1), except for when we need to add to a completely full array when it is O(N).

template: growing-array

.center[
<img alt="growing an array"  width="500" height="375" src="img/05/ArrayList1.png"/>
]

- creating a new array and copying the data is fairly easy, but how much more room should we allocate?
    - if it is too large, then we have an array that is much too big for our data
    - if it is too little, then we might need to do this again, and again, and again

---

template: growing-array

```java
    public boolean add(E element) {
        if (size >= array.length) {
            // make a bigger array and copy over the elements
            E[] bigger = (E[]) new Object[array.length * 2];
            System.arraycopy(array, 0, bigger, 0, array.length);
            array = bigger;
        }
        array[size] = element;
        size++;
        return true;
    }
```

--

- where does the O(N) time come from in the above function
--

    - `arraycopy()` is linear, it runs in time proportional to the size of the array
    - but it is in practice faster than executing:
        ```java
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
            bigger[i] = array[i];
        ```
--
- so what is the performance of this function overall (not just sometimes O(1) and sometimes O(N))?

---
## Growing the Array - Amortized Analysis

If the initial size of the array is N, then

- .small[adding first element takes O(1)]

--
- .small[adding second element takes O(1)]

--
- .small[...]

--
- .small[adding $N^{th}$ element takes O(1)]

--
- .small[adding $N+1^{st}$ element takes O(N)]

--

Intuitively, we have N \* O(1) + 1 \* O(N) to add N+1 elements -> this is still a constant time for each operation (almost).


--

In __amortized analysis__ we are interested in the performance of a given operation on average - when we repeat
the operation many time and calculate how much time it took divided by the number of repeats.
(See [Amortized Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis) on Wikipedia for more formal details.)

--
.center80[.yellowbox[
The add at the end (append) operation for an ArrayList has an amortized time performance of O(1) as long as the
array size in increased by a multiplicative factor, not an additive factor.
]]
--

- this means that we need to multiply the current size of an array by a constant to get the size of the bigger array:
if N starts as 10, and the multiplicative constant is 2, the sizes will be: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, ...

--

- __not__ add some constant to the current size:
if N starts at 10, and the additive constant is 2, the sizes would be: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, ...

# Adding and Removing

## Adding at an Arbitrary Position

If we want to add an element to an arbitrary position in the list, we will need to shift
the values that are there to the higher indexes to make room for it.

--

<video controls="controls" width="500" height="375"

]

---

template: adding

.center[
<img alt="growing an array"  width="500" height="375" src="img/05/ArrayList_add.png"/>
]

This operation is O(N) because we need to shift the elements by one position to
the right (higher indexes).



---
name: removing
## Removing from an Arbitrary Position

If we want to remove an element from an arbitrary position in the list, we will need to shift
the values in the higher indexes to fill in the _whole_ that remains after removing
an element.

]

---

template: removing

.center[
<img alt="growing an array"  width="500" height="375" src="img/05/ArrayList_remove.png"/>
]

This operation is O(N) because we need to shift the elements by one position to
the left (lower indexes).

# Comparing `ArrayList<E>` Objects for Equality

---
## `equals` method specification

The `equals` method in the `ArrayList<E>` class is inherited from  the
`AbstractList<E>` class.

----

--

`public boolean equalsâ€‹(Object o)`

Compares the specified object with this list for equality. Returns true if and
only if the specified object is also a list, both lists have the same size, and
all corresponding pairs of elements in the two lists are equal.
(Two elements `e1` and `e2` are equal if (`e1==null ? e2==null : e1.equals(e2))`.)
In other words, two lists are defined to be equal if they contain the same elements
in the same order.

__Implementation Requirements__:
This implementation first checks if the specified object is this list.
If so, it returns `true`; if not, it checks if the specified object is a list. If
 not, it returns `false`; if so, it iterates over both lists, comparing corresponding
pairs of elements. If any comparison returns `false`, this method returns `false`.
If either iterator runs out of elements before the other it returns `false` (as
the lists are of unequal length); otherwise it returns `true` when the
iterations complete.

__Parameters__:
    `o` - the object to be compared for equality with this list

__Returns__:
    `true` if the specified object is equal to this list

--


.box[
Note that this specification allows us to use `equals` to compare different implementations
of a list, for example an `ArrayList` instance with a `LinkedList` instance. The only
requirement is that they contain the same elements in the same order.
]
---
## `equals` method implementation

This is the code from `AbstractList<E>` class.

```java
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (o == this)              //check if the specified object is this list
        return true;
    if (!(o instanceof List))   //check if the specified object is a list
        return false;

    //iterate over both lists, comparing corresponding pairs of elements
    ListIterator<E> e1 = listIterator();
    ListIterator<?> e2 = ((List<?>) o).listIterator();
    while (e1.hasNext() && e2.hasNext()) {
        E o1 = e1.next();
        Object o2 = e2.next();
        if (!(o1==null ? o2==null : o1.equals(o2)))
            return false;
    }
    return !(e1.hasNext() || e2.hasNext());
}
```


---
## `equals` method aternative implementation

This is an alternative implementation of the same method.

```java
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (o == this)              //check if the specified object is this list
        return true;
    if (!(o instanceof List))   //check if the specified object is a list
        return false;

    //check if lists are of the same length
    if (this.size() != ((List<?>) o).size() ) {
        return false;
    }
    //iterate over both lists, comparing corresponding pairs of elements
    for (int i = 0; i < this.size(); i++ ) {
        E o1 = this.get(i);
        Object o2 = ((List<?>) o).get(i);
        if (!(o1==null ? o2==null : o1.equals(o2)))
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

What is the performance of this function?

# `ArrayList<E>` Summary

---

## `ArrayList<E>`

- __Capacity__ of an `ArrayList<E>` is the size of the actual array used for storing data.
- __Size__ of an `ArrayList<E>` is the number of elements that have been stored in it.

$$ Capacity \geq Size $$

- An empty list will often have a non-zero capacity.
- Capacity is not decreased as elements are removed (could be, but the `ArrayList<E>` class does not do it).
  But it can be reduced by an explicit call to `trimToSize()`

# Examples and Things to Think About

---

## Implementing `contains` and `indexOf`

Without looking at the source code of the `ArrayList<E>` class, implement
the `contains` and `indexOf` methods.

Use the documentation to find out exactly what they are supposed to do.

Once you have your code, compare it to the one in the `ArrayList<E>` class and
see how similar/different it is.
- Is it equivalent (i.e., does your do do the same thing that
the `ArrayList<E>` code does )?
- Does it have the same performance?


---

## Binary search on an `ArrayList<E>`

The `contains()` and `indexOf` methods provides a linear search for the `ArrayList<E>`.
    But we know that a binary search is much more efficient if the data is sorted.

- Write a method `boolean isSorted (ArrayList<E> list )` that determines if the
    given list is sorted or not.

- Write a method `int binSearch(ArrayList<E> list, E key)` that performs the binary search
    and returns the index of `key` or -1 if the `key` is not present in the `list`.

- Write a method `int bestSearch(ArrayList<E> list, E key)` that first determines
    if the list is sorted or not, and selects to either use `binSearch` or `indexOf` method
    accordingly.

Note that the above methods are NOT part of the `ArrayList<E> ` class. They should be implemented
    as stand alone methods.
